## Introduction to OSP

### 1 What is OSP?

Object-Spatial Programming models data as graphs and computation as mobile agents (walkers) that traverse the graph. Instead of calling functions on objects, walkers visit nodes and perform operations based on location.

### 2 Why OSP?

- **Natural graph modeling**: Social networks, knowledge graphs, state machines
- **AI agent architecture**: Walkers are natural representations of AI agents
- **Separation of concerns**: Data (nodes/edges) separate from behavior (walkers)
- **Spatial context**: `here`, `visitor` provide natural context

### 3 Core Concepts

| Concept | Description | Keyword |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Node** | Graph vertex holding data | `node` |
| **Edge** | Connection between nodes | `edge` |
| **Walker** | Mobile agent that traverses | `walker` |
| **Root** | Entry point to graph | `root` |
| **Here** | Walker's current location | `here` |
| **Visitor** | Reference to visiting walker | `visitor` |

### 4 Complete Example

```jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
    has age: int;
}

edge Knows {
    has since: int;
}

walker Greeter {
    can greet with Root entry {
        visit [-->];
    }

    can say_hello with Person entry {
        print(f"Hello, {here.name}!");
        visit [-->];
    }
}

with entry {
    # Build graph
    alice = Person(name="Alice", age=30);
    bob = Person(name="Bob", age=25);

    root ++> alice;
    alice +>: Knows(since=2020) :+> bob;

    # Spawn walker
    root spawn Greeter();
}
```

## Nodes

Nodes are the vertices of your graph -- they hold data and can have abilities that execute when walkers visit them. Think of nodes as "smart objects" that know when they're being visited and can react accordingly. Unlike regular objects, nodes can be connected via edges and participate in graph traversals.

### 1 Node Declaration

```jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
    has age: int = 0;

    can greet with Visitor entry {
        print(f"Hello from {self.name}");
    }
}

# Node with no data
node Waypoint { }
```

### 2 Node Entry/Exit Abilities

Abilities triggered when walkers enter or exit. The event clause syntax is:

```
can ability_name with [TypeExpression] (entry | exit) { ... }
```

Where `TypeExpression` is optional - if omitted, the ability triggers for ALL walkers.

```jac
node SecureRoom {
    has clearance_required: int;

    # Generic entry - triggers for ANY walker (no type filter)
    can on_enter with entry {
        print("Someone entered");
    }

    # Typed entry - triggers only for Inspector walkers
    can check_clearance with Inspector entry {
        if visitor.clearance < self.clearance_required {
            print("Access denied");
            disengage;
        }
    }

    # Typed entry for Root walker - in node abilities, the type in
    # 'with Type entry' refers to the *walker* type visiting this node,
    # NOT the node type. This triggers when a walker of type Root visits.
    can at_root with Root entry {
        print("A Root-type walker is visiting this node");
    }

    # Walker exiting
    can on_exit with Inspector exit {
        print("Inspector leaving");
    }

    # Multiple walker types (union)
    can process with Walker1 | Walker2 entry {
        print("Processing for Walker1 or Walker2");
    }
}
```

**Event Clause Forms:**

| Form | Triggers When |
|------|---------------|
| `with entry` | Any walker enters (no type filter) |
| `with TypeName entry` | Walker of TypeName enters |
| `with Root entry` | Walker of type Root visits (in node context, the type refers to the *walker* type) |
| `with Type1 \| Type2 entry` | Walker of either type enters |
| `with exit` | Any walker exits |
| `with TypeName exit` | Walker of TypeName exits |

### 3 Node Inheritance

```jac
node Entity {
    has created_at: str;
}

node User(Entity) {
    has username: str;
    has email: str;
}
```

---

## Edges

Edges are first-class connections between nodes. Unlike simple object references, edges can carry their own data (like relationship strength or timestamps) and have their own types. This lets you model rich relationships -- "Alice *knows* Bob *since 2020*" becomes natural to express. Use typed edges when the relationship itself has meaningful attributes.

### 1 Edge Declaration

```jac
edge Friend {
    has since: int;
    has strength: float = 1.0;
}

edge Follows { }  # Edge with no data

edge Weighted {
    has weight: float;

    def get_normalized(max_weight: float) -> float {
        return self.weight / max_weight;
    }
}
```

### 2 Edge Entry/Exit

Walkers can trigger abilities on edges during traversal:

```jac
edge Road {
    has distance: float;

    can on_traverse with Traveler entry {
        visitor.total_distance += self.distance;
    }
}
```

!!! warning "Known Limitation"
    Edge entry/exit abilities are not currently triggered during walker traversal. This feature is planned but not yet implemented. For now, perform edge-related logic in the walker's node abilities instead.

### 3 Directed vs Undirected

Edge direction is determined by connection operators:

```jac
node Item {}

with entry {
    a = Item();
    b = Item();

    a ++> b;          # Directed: a → b
    a <++> b;         # Undirected: a ↔ b (creates edges both ways)
}
```

### 4 Typed Edge Endpoints

By default an edge can connect *any* node types, so a neighbour traversal such as `[here ->:Friend:->]` has element type `any` and needs a `[?:Type]` filter before you can read a field off the result. You can instead declare the **source** and **target** node types an edge connects, after a `:`, using the traversal arrow so it reads like the navigation it enables:

```jac
node Profile { has name: str = ""; }
node Tweet { has content: str = ""; }

edge Follow: Profile --> Profile {}      # Profile → Profile
edge Post: Profile --> Tweet {}          # Profile → Tweet
```

With endpoints declared, a neighbour traversal **infers the declared node type** -- no `[?:Type]` filter needed:

```jac
with entry {
    me = Profile(name="me");
    following = [me ->:Follow:->];   # inferred list[Profile] (target)
    followers = [me <-:Follow:<-];   # inferred list[Profile] (source)
    my_tweets = [me ->:Post:->];     # inferred list[Tweet]

    # The element type is concrete, so field access resolves statically
    # (and compiles on the native backend) -- no filter required:
    if following {
        print(following[0].name);
    }
}
```

An outgoing traversal (`->:Edge:->`) narrows to the **target** type; an incoming traversal (`<-:Edge:<-`) narrows to the **source** type. A `[?:Sub]` filter can still narrow *further* to a subtype.

Typed endpoints are **opt-in and gradual**: an untyped `edge Link {}` keeps `any → any` connectivity and `list[any]` traversal results, so existing code is unaffected. The endpoint type is a **bound** -- `Profile` *or a subtype* -- so subclass-heterogeneous graphs stay valid.

The `()` after the name remains reserved for **edge inheritance**, orthogonal to the endpoints. A subtype edge inherits its base edge's endpoints unless it re-declares them:

```jac
edge TimedFollow(Follow) { has at: str = ""; }          # inherits Profile → Profile
edge BlockedFollow(Follow): Profile --> Profile {}      # re-declares its endpoints
```

The endpoint clause is only valid on an `edge`; placing it on a `node`, `walker`, or `obj` is a compile error (`E2027`).

## Walkers

Walkers are mobile agents that traverse the graph, executing abilities at each node they visit. Unlike functions that you call, walkers *go to* data. They maintain state throughout their journey, making them ideal for tasks like collecting information across a graph, implementing AI agents that navigate knowledge structures, or processing pipelines where context accumulates. Spawn a walker with `root spawn MyWalker()` to begin traversal.

### 1 Walker Declaration

```jac
walker Collector {
    has items: list = [];
    has max_items: int = 10;

    can start with Root entry {
        print("Starting collection");
        visit [-->];
    }

    can collect with DataNode entry {
        if len(self.items) < self.max_items {
            self.items.append(here.value);
        }
        visit [-->];
    }
}
```

### 2 Walker State

Walkers maintain state throughout their traversal:

```jac
node DataNode {
    has value: int;
}

walker Counter {
    has count: int = 0;

    can start with Root entry {
        self.count += 1;
        visit [-->];
    }

    can count_nodes with DataNode entry {
        self.count += 1;
        visit [-->];
    }
}

with entry {
    root ++> DataNode(value=1) ++> DataNode(value=2);
    walker_instance = Counter();
    root spawn walker_instance;
    print(f"Counted {walker_instance.count} nodes");  # Output: 3
}
```

> **Note:** Walker abilities must specify which node types they handle. Use `Root` for the root node and specific node types for others. A generic `with entry` only triggers at the spawn location.

### 3 The `visit` Statement

The `visit` statement tells the walker where to go next. It doesn't immediately move -- it queues nodes for the next step of traversal. This queue-based approach lets you control breadth-first vs depth-first traversal and handle cases where there's nowhere to go (using the `else` clause).

!!! warning "Traversal Must Be Explicit"
    Without a `visit` statement in an ability, the walker stops at the current node. If a walker visits root and then reaches a `Person` node but the `Person` ability has no `visit [-->]`, the walker will not continue to the next person. Traversal must be explicitly requested at each step.

**Basic Syntax:**

```jac
node Item {}

walker Visitor {
    can go with Item entry {
        visit [-->];                    # Visit all outgoing nodes
        visit [<--];                    # Visit all incoming nodes
        visit [<-->];                   # Visit both directions
    }
}
```

**With Type Filters:**

```jac
node Person {}
edge Friend { has since: int = 2020; }

walker Visitor {
    can filter with Person entry {
        visit [-->][?:Person];          # Visit Person nodes only
        visit [->:Friend:->];           # Visit via Friend edges only
        visit [->:Friend:since>2020:->]; # Via Friend edges with condition
    }
}
```

**With Else Clause:**

```jac
node Item {}

walker Visitor {
    can traverse with Item entry {
        visit [-->] else {              # Fallback if no nodes to visit
            print("No outgoing edges");
        }
    }
}
```

**Direct Node Visit:**

```jac
node Item {}

walker Visitor {
    has target: Item | None = None;

    can direct with Item entry {
        visit here;                     # Visit current node
        visit self.target;              # Visit node stored in walker field
    }
}
```

**Queue Insertion Index:**

The `visit : index : [-->]` syntax controls *where* in the walker's traversal queue new destinations are inserted. This enables DFS, BFS, and custom traversal strategies:

```jac
node Item {}

walker Visitor {
    can traverse with Item entry {
        visit : 0 : [-->];              # Insert at FRONT of queue (DFS behavior)
        visit : -1 : [-->];             # Insert at END of queue (BFS behavior)
        visit : 2 : [-->];              # Insert at position 2 in queue
    }
}
```

| Syntax | Queue Position | Effect |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| `visit [-->]` | End (default) | BFS-like -- standard breadth-first traversal |
| `visit : 0 : [-->]` | Front | DFS-like -- depth-first by inserting at front |
| `visit : -1 : [-->]` | End | Explicit BFS -- same as default |
| `visit : N : [-->]` | Position N | Custom insertion point |

Out-of-bounds indices fall back to appending at the end.

### 4 The `report` Statement

Send data back without stopping. Each `report` appends to the `.reports` array and also prints the value to stdout.

!!! note
    `report value;` both adds `value` to `.reports` **and** prints it to stdout. Keep this in mind when reading output from walker examples.

```jac
node DataNode {
    has value: int = 0;
}

walker DataCollector {
    can start with Root entry {
        visit [-->];
    }

    can collect with DataNode entry {
        report here.value;  # Continues execution
        visit [-->];
    }
}

with entry {
    root ++> DataNode(value=1);
    result = root spawn DataCollector();
    all_values = result.reports;  # List of reported values
}
```

You can declare `has reports` with a type to get compile-time checking on `report` statements:

```jac
walker DataCollector {
    has reports: list[int];

    can start with Root entry { visit [-->]; }
    can collect with DataNode entry {
        report here.value;  # checked against int
        visit [-->];
    }
}
```

If omitted, `reports` defaults to `list[any]`. See [Walker Response Patterns](walker-responses.md#typing-your-reports) for details.

### 5 The `disengage` Statement

The `disengage` statement immediately terminates a walker's traversal. Use it when the walker has found what it was looking for (like a search hitting its target) or when a condition means further traversal would be pointless. It's the walker equivalent of `return` from a recursive function.

```jac
walker Searcher {
    has target: str;

    can search with Person entry {
        if here.name == self.target {
            report here;
            disengage;  # Stop traversal
        }
        visit [-->];
    }
}
```

#### `skip` vs `disengage`

`skip` and `disengage` are easy to confuse, but they operate at different scopes. `skip` is a return-family statement (alongside `return`/`yield`/`report`) -- it is **not** a loop control like `continue`, despite the "skip an iteration" connotation of the word.

| Statement | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| `skip;` | Returns from the **current ability only** -- equivalent to a bare `return;`. The walker continues: any sibling abilities bound to the same node still run, and traversal proceeds through nodes already queued by `visit`. |
| `disengage;` | Terminates the **whole walker** -- no further abilities run and no further nodes are visited. |

Because `skip` is just an early `return`, a `skip` reached *before* this ability's `visit` statement means this ability queued no next nodes; the walker will only continue to nodes queued elsewhere (and stops if none remain).

```jac
walker Auditor {
    can check with Account entry {
        if not here.active {
            skip;          # this account isn't ours to process; move on
        }
        report here.balance;
        visit [-->];       # not reached for inactive accounts
    }
}
```

### 6 Spawning Walkers

```jac
node Item { has value: int = 0; }

walker MyWalker {
    has param: int = 0;

    can visit with Root entry {
        visit [-->];
    }
    can collect with Item entry {
        report here.value;
        visit [-->];
    }
}

with entry {
    node1 = Item(value=1);
    node2 = Item(value=2);
    node3 = Item(value=3);
    root ++> node1 ++> node2 ++> node3;

    # Basic spawn
    result = root spawn MyWalker();

    # Spawn with parameters
    result = root spawn MyWalker(param=10);

    # Access results
    print(result.reports);  # All reported values
}
```

### When to Use Walkers vs Functions

Jac provides two ways to expose server logic: `def:pub` functions and `walker` types. Choose based on your needs:

| | `def:pub` Functions | Walkers |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Simple stateless CRUD, quick prototyping | Graph traversal, per-user data, production apps |
| **Auth** | Shared data (no user isolation) | Per-user root node (`walker:priv` enforces auth) |
| **Data access** | Direct: `[root -->]` | Traversal: `visit [-->]`, `here` |
| **API style** | Function call → HTTP endpoint | Spawn walker at node |
| **State** | Stateless | Carries state across nodes via `has` properties |

!!! tip "Rule of Thumb"
    Start with `def:pub` to prototype quickly. Switch to walkers when you need authentication, per-user data isolation, or multi-step graph traversal. The `walker:priv` visibility modifier automatically enforces that the walker runs on the authenticated user's private root node.

### Walkers as REST APIs

Public walkers automatically become HTTP endpoints when you run `jac start`:

```jac
node Todo {
    has title: str;
    has done: bool = False;
}

walker add_todo {
    has title: str;

    can create with Root entry {
        new_todo = here ++> Todo(title=self.title);
        report new_todo;
    }
}

walker list_todos {
    can list with Root entry {
        for todo in [-->][?:Todo] {
            report todo;
        }
    }
}
```

!!! note
    `main.jac` is the default entry point. If your file has a different name (e.g., `app.jac`), pass it explicitly: `jac start app.jac`.

```bash
# Run as API server
jac start

# Call via HTTP
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/walker/add_todo \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Learn OSP"}'
```

Walker `has` properties become the request body. The `report` values become the response. See [Part IV: Full-Stack](../plugins/jac-client.md) and the [Scale Reference](../plugins/jac-scale.md) for full API documentation.

### 7 Walker Inheritance

```jac
walker BaseVisitor {
    can log with entry {
        print(f"Visiting: {here}");
        visit [-->];
    }
}

walker DetailedVisitor(BaseVisitor) {
    override can log with entry {
        print(f"Detailed visit to: {type(here).__name__}");
        visit [-->];
    }
}
```

### 8 Special References

These keywords have special meaning in specific contexts:

| Reference | Valid Context | Description | See Also |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| `self` | Any method/ability | Current instance (walker, node, object) | [Part II: Functions](functions-objects.md#object-oriented-programming) |
| `here` | Walker ability | Current node the walker is visiting | [Walkers](#walkers) |
| `visitor` | Node ability | The walker that triggered this ability | [Nodes](#nodes) |
| `root` | Anywhere | Root node of the current graph | [Graph Construction](#graph-construction) |
| `super` | Subclass method | Parent class reference | [Part II](functions-objects.md#2-inheritance) |
| `init` | Object body | Constructor method name | [Part II](functions-objects.md#1-objects-classes) |
| `postinit` | Object body | Post-constructor hook | [Part I](foundation.md#2-instance-variables-has) |
| `props` | JSX context | Component props reference | [Part IV: Full-Stack](../plugins/jac-client.md#client-blocks) |

**Usage examples:**

```jac
node SecureRoom {
    has required_level: int;

    # 'visitor' refers to the walker visiting this node
    # 'self' refers to this node instance
    can check with Inspector entry {
        if visitor.clearance >= self.required_level {
            print("Access granted to " + visitor.name);
        }
    }
}

walker Inspector {
    has clearance: int;
    has name: str;

    # 'here' refers to the current node being visited
    # 'self' refers to this walker instance
    can inspect with SecureRoom entry {
        print(f"{self.name} inspecting room at {here}");
        print(f"Room requires level {here.required_level}");
    }

    can start with Root entry {
        # 'root' is always the graph root
        print(f"Starting from root: {root}");
        visit [-->];
    }
}
```

**When each reference is valid:**

| Context | `self` | `here` | `visitor` | `root` |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Walker ability | Walker instance | Current node | N/A | Graph root |
| Node ability | Node instance | N/A | Visiting walker | Graph root |
| Object method | Object instance | N/A | N/A | Graph root |
| Free code | N/A | N/A | N/A | Graph root |

## Graph Construction

### 1 Creating Nodes

```jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
    has age: int;
}

with entry {
    # Create and assign
    alice = Person(name="Alice", age=30);
    bob = Person(name="Bob", age=25);

    # Inline creation in connection
    root ++> Person(name="Charlie", age=35);
}
```

!!! note "The `++>` operator mirrors its right-hand side"
    A `++>` connection returns whatever its right-hand side is: connecting to a **single** node returns that node, connecting to a **list** of nodes returns a list. No `[0]` indexing is needed for a single-node connect:

    <!-- jac-skip: fragment shown in context of a walker ability -->
    ```jac
    created_todo = here ++> Todo(title="Buy groceries");  # the created node
    report created_todo;
    ```

### 2 Creating Edges

```jac
node Person { has name: str; }
edge Friend { has since: int = 2020; }
edge Colleague { has department: str = ""; }

with entry {
    alice = Person(name="Alice");
    bob = Person(name="Bob");

    # Untyped (generic edge)
    alice ++> bob;

    # Typed edge
    alice +>: Friend(since=2020) :+> bob;

    # Bidirectional typed
    alice <+: Colleague(department="Engineering") :+> bob;
}
```

### 3 Chained Construction

```jac
node Item {}
edge Start {}
edge Next {}
edge End {}

with entry {
    a = Item();
    b = Item();
    c = Item();
    d = Item();

    # Build chains in one expression
    root ++> a ++> b ++> c ++> d;

    # With typed edges
    root +>: Start :+> a +>: Next :+> b +>: Next :+> c +>: End :+> d;
}
```

### 4 Deleting Nodes and Edges

```jac
node Person { has name: str; }
edge Friend {}

with entry {
    alice = Person(name="Alice");
    bob = Person(name="Bob");
    alice +>: Friend :+> bob;

    # Delete specific edge
    alice del --> bob;

    # Delete node
    del bob;
}

# Delete current node from within a walker
walker Cleanup {
    can check with Todo entry {
        if here.completed {
            node_id = jid(here);
            del here;
            report {"deleted": node_id};
        }
    }
}
```

#### Cascade Deletion Pattern

Delete a node and all its related nodes:

```jac
walker:priv DeleteWithChildren {
    has parent_id: str;

    can search with Root entry {
        visit [-->];
    }

    can delete with Todo entry {
        # Delete if this is the target or a child of the target
        if jid(here) == self.parent_id or here.parent_id == self.parent_id {
            del here;
        }
    }
}
```

### 5 Built-in Graph Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `jid(node)` | Get unique Jac ID of object |
| `jobj(node)` | Get Jac object wrapper |
| `grant(node, user)` | Grant access permission |
| `revoke(node, user)` | Revoke access permission |
| `allroots()` | Get all root references |
| `save(node)` | Persist node to storage |
| `commit()` | Commit pending changes |

with entry {
    alice = Person(name="Alice");

    secret_node = Person(name="Secret");

    save(alice);

}
```

### 6 The Shared Root (`root.shared`)

Every served deployment has one public graph alongside the per-user roots: the **shared root**, the root that every unauthenticated request runs on. `root.shared` resolves to it from any request context, so a walker can read or extend the public graph directly - no `allroots()` fan-out, no passing root ids around:

```jac
node Post { has text: str; }
edge Posted {}

walker:pub publish {
    has text: str;

    can run with Root entry {
        # Lands on the public graph whoever the caller is.
        fresh = root.shared +>: Posted() :+> Post(text=self.text);
        grant(fresh, level=ReadPerm);   # author opens the post to readers
    }
}

walker:pub read_feed {
    can run with Root entry {
        report [p.text for p in [root.shared-->[?:Post]]];
    }
}
```

**Default policy.** The shared root is a commons: its access level is floored at `ConnectPerm`, so every user - authenticated or anonymous - can read it and attach nodes to it without any arming grant. The floor reflects reality rather than weakening security: anonymous requests already act as the shared root's owner through any public endpoint, so withholding access from authenticated users protects nothing.

**Ownership stays the boundary.** Nodes a user hangs on the shared graph remain owned by that user and closed until the author grants. The conventional levels: `ConnectPerm` on container nodes others should build under, `ReadPerm` on leaf contributions others should only see. Anonymous-created content is collectively owned by the anonymous identity and is readable by everyone through the floor.

**Lockdown.** An app can lower the commons explicitly - for example `grant(root.shared, level=ReadPerm)` from an anonymous or system context makes it read-only. Any explicitly set level other than `NoPerm` is respected; only the never-granted state is floored back to `ConnectPerm`.

Outside a server (CLI runs, scripts, tests without a server) there are no separate users, so `root.shared` is the current root itself: `jid(root.shared) == jid(root)`.

## Graph Traversal

### 1 Basic Traversal

Walker traversal is queue-based (BFS-like by default):

```jac
walker BFSWalker {
    can start with Root entry {
        print(f"Starting at: {here}");
        visit [-->];
    }

    can traverse with Person entry {
        print(f"Visiting: {here.name}");
        visit [-->];  # Queue all outgoing for later visits
    }
}
```

### Traversal Semantics: Deferred Exits

Walker traversal uses recursive post-order exit execution. Entry abilities execute immediately when entering a node, while **exit abilities are deferred** until all descendants are visited. This means exits execute in LIFO order (last visited node exits first), similar to function call stack unwinding.

```jac
node Step { has label: str; }

walker Logger {
    can start with Root entry {
        visit [-->];  # Begin traversal from root
    }

    can enter with Step entry {
        print(f"ENTER: {here.label}");
        visit [-->];
    }

    can leave with Step exit {
        print(f"EXIT: {here.label}");
    }
}

# Setup: root -> A -> B -> C
# root spawn Logger();
#
# Output:
#   ENTER: A
#   ENTER: B
#   ENTER: C
#   EXIT: C    ← innermost exits first
#   EXIT: B
#   EXIT: A    ← outermost exits last
```

This is useful for aggregation patterns where you need to collect results from children before processing the parent (e.g., calculating subtree totals, building trees bottom-up).

### 2 Filtered Traversal

```jac
node Person { has age: int = 0; }
edge Friend { has since: int = 2020; }

walker FilteredWalker {
    can start with Root entry {
        visit [-->];  # Start traversal from root
    }

    can traverse with Person entry {
        # By node type
        visit [-->][?:Person];

        # By edge type
        visit [->:Friend:->];

        # Combined: Friend edges to Person nodes since 2020
        visit [->:Friend:since > 2020:->][?:Person];
    }
}
```

!!! tip "Skip the `[?:Type]` filter"
    If an edge declares its endpoint node types (see [Typed Edge Endpoints](#4-typed-edge-endpoints)), a neighbour traversal already infers the concrete node type, so the trailing `[?:Type]` filter is only needed to narrow *further* to a subtype.

### 3 Entry and Exit Events

```jac
node Room {
    can on_enter with Visitor entry {
        print("Entering room");
    }

    can on_exit with Visitor exit {
        print("Exiting room");
    }
}
```

## Object Spatial Queries

### 1 Edge Reference Syntax

```jac
node Person {}
edge EdgeType {}
edge Edge { has attr: int = 0; has a: int = 0; has b: int = 0; }
edge Friend {}

walker Traverser {
    can query with Person entry {
        # Basic forms
        outgoing = [-->];                     # All outgoing nodes
        incoming = [<--];                     # All incoming nodes
        both = [<-->];                        # Both directions

        # Typed forms
        via_type = [->:EdgeType:->];          # Outgoing via EdgeType

        # With conditions
        filtered = [->:Edge:attr > 0:->];     # Filter by edge attribute

        # Node type filter
        people = [-->][?:Person];             # Filter result nodes by type

        # Get edges vs nodes
        edges = [edge -->];                   # Get edge objects
        friends = [edge ->:Friend:->];        # Typed edge objects
    }
}
```

Use `[edge -->]` when you need to access edge attributes or visit edges directly.

### 2 Attribute Filtering

```jac
node User {
    has age: int = 0;
    has status: str = "";
    has verified: bool = False;
}
edge Friend { has since: int = 2020; }
edge Link { has weight: float = 0.0; }

walker Filter {
    can query with User entry {
        # Filter by node attributes (after traversal)
        adults = [-->][?age >= 18];
        active = [-->][?status == "active"];

        # Filter by edge attributes (during traversal)
        recent_friends = [->:Friend:since > 2020:->];
        strong_connections = [->:Link:weight > 0.8:->];
    }
}
```

### 3 Complex Queries

```jac
node Person { has age: int = 0; }
edge Friend { has since: int = 2020; }
edge Colleague {}

walker Querier {
    can complex with Person entry {
        # Chained traversal (multi-hop)
        friends_of_friends = [here ->:Friend:-> ->:Friend:->];

        # Mixed edge types
        path = [here ->:Friend:-> ->:Colleague:->];

        # Combined with filters
        target = [->:Friend:since < 2020:->][?:Person, age > 30];
    }
}
```

## Typed Context Blocks

### 1 What are Typed Context Blocks?

Typed context blocks let you conditionally execute code based on the runtime type of the current node. Instead of writing separate abilities for each node type, you can handle multiple types within a single ability using `->Type{code}` blocks. This is especially useful when a walker visits a heterogeneous graph with different node types.

The syntax uses `->Type{code}` with no space between the arrow and type name:

```jac
node Animal { has name: str = ""; }
node Dog(Animal) {}
node Cat(Animal) {}

walker AnimalVisitor {
    can visit with Animal entry {
        # Typed context block for Dog (subtype of Animal)
        ->Dog{print(f"{here.name} is a dog");}

        # Typed context block for Cat (subtype of Animal)
        ->Cat{print(f"{here.name} says meow");}
    }
}
```

**Syntax Notes:**

- No space between `->` and the type name: `->Dog{` not `-> Dog {`
- Opening brace immediately follows the type
- Code typically on same line with closing brace
- For a default/catch-all branch, add a final ability triggered on the base type (e.g. `can default with Animal entry { ... }`) or use an `else` branch on an `if isinstance(...)` chain. The `->_{}` wildcard form is not supported.

### 2 Union-Based Dispatch

A single ability can fire on multiple node types using the `|` union syntax:

```jac
node Node1 { has v: int = 0; }
node Node2 { has v: int = 0; }

walker Processor {
    can process with Node1 | Node2 entry {
        # Handles either node type; here is typed as Node1 | Node2
        print(here.v);
    }
}
```

### 3 Context Blocks in Nodes

Nodes can react to a specific walker by naming the walker type as the trigger. To handle *any* walker, use the anonymous form (`can handle with entry { ... }`) -- there is no built-in `Walker` catch-all type.

```jac
walker Reader {}
walker Writer { has new_value: int = 0; }

node DataNode {
    has value: int = 0;

    # Anonymous ability fires for every walker that visits this node
    can handle with entry {
        print(f"Visited by {type(visitor).__name__}, value={self.value}");
    }
}
```

### 4 Complex Typed Context Example

From the reference examples, showing inheritance-based dispatch:

```jac
walker ShoppingCart {
    can process_item with Product entry {
        print(f"Processing {type(here).__name__}...");

        # Each subtype gets its own block
        ->Book{print(f"  -> Book: '{here.title}' by {here.author}");}
        ->Magazine{print(f"  -> Magazine: '{here.title}' Issue #{here.issue}");}
        ->Electronics{print(f"  -> Electronics: {here.name}, warranty {here.warranty_years}yr");}

        self.total += here.price;
        visit [-->];
    }
}
```

## Common Walker Patterns

### CRUD Walker

```jac
# Create
walker:priv CreateItem {
    has name: str;
    can create with Root entry {
        new_item = here ++> Item(name=self.name);
        report new_item;
    }
}

# Read (List)
walker:priv ListItems {
    has items: list = [];
    can collect with Root entry { visit [-->]; }
    can gather with Item entry { self.items.append(here); }
    can finish with Root exit { report self.items; }
}

# Update
walker:priv UpdateItem {
    has item_id: str;
    has new_name: str;
    can find with Root entry { visit [-->]; }
    can update with Item entry {
        if jid(here) == self.item_id {
            here.name = self.new_name;
            report here;
        }
    }
}

# Delete
walker:priv DeleteItem {
    has item_id: str;
    can find with Root entry { visit [-->]; }
    can remove with Item entry {
        if jid(here) == self.item_id {
            del here;
            report {"deleted": self.item_id};
        }
    }
}
```

### Search Walker

```jac
node Item {
    has name: str;
}

def calculate_relevance(item: Item, query: str) -> int {
    return 1;
}

walker:priv SearchItems {
    has query: str;
    has matches: list = [];

    can start with Root entry {
        visit [-->];
    }

    can check with Item entry {
        if self.query.lower() in here.name.lower() {
            self.matches.append({
                "id": jid(here),
                "name": here.name,
                "score": calculate_relevance(here, self.query)
            });
        }
    }

    can finish with Root exit {
        self.matches.sort(key=lambda x: any: x["score"], reverse=True);
        report self.matches;
    }
}
```

### Hierarchical Traversal

<!-- This example illustrates the pattern conceptually; [node -->] inside a def
     method is not standard walker traversal syntax. A production implementation
     would use recursive walker spawning or accumulate results via entry/exit abilities. -->

```
walker:priv GetTree {
    def build_tree(node: any) -> dict {
        children = [];
        for child in [node -->] {
            children.append(self.build_tree(child));
        }
        return {
            "id": jid(node),
            "name": node.name,
            "children": children
        };
    }

    can start with Root entry {
        tree = self.build_tree(here);
        report tree;
    }
}
```

!!! note "Pseudocode"
    The above example illustrates the hierarchical traversal pattern conceptually. The `[node -->]` syntax inside a `def` method and the use of `here` outside a walker ability context may not work as written. In practice, use recursive walker spawning or accumulate results via entry/exit abilities.

### Aggregate Walker

```jac
walker:priv GetStats {
    has total: int = 0;
    has completed: int = 0;

    can count with Root entry {
        visit [-->];
    }

    can tally with Todo entry {
        self.total += 1;
        if here.completed {
            self.completed += 1;
        }
    }

    can summarize with Root exit {
        report {
            "total": self.total,
            "completed": self.completed,
            "pending": self.total - self.completed,
            "completion_rate": (self.completed / self.total * 100) if self.total > 0 else 0
        };
    }
}
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use specific entry points** -- `with Todo entry` is more efficient than generic `with entry`
2. **Accumulate then report** -- Collect data during traversal, report once at exit
3. **Handle empty graphs** -- Always check if traversal found anything
4. **Use meaningful node types** -- Makes code self-documenting
5. **Keep walkers focused** -- One walker, one responsibility
