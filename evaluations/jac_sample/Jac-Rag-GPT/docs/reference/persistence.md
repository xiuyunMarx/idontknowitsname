# Persistence & Schema Migration

Jac apps persist their object-spatial graph automatically. Anything reachable from `root` survives across runs -- but the schema of your `node`/`obj`/`edge`/`walker` archetypes inevitably evolves: you add a field, rename one, change a type, rename a class. This page covers what happens when you do.

The short version: **edits never delete persisted data**. Schema changes are tolerated, type changes are coerced, and rows that genuinely can't be loaded land in a quarantine sidecar instead of being dropped. You inspect and rescue them with [`jac db`](cli/index.md#database-operations). For changes that need intent -- a field rename, a custom value transform -- archetypes declare their history in a [`__jac_schema__` hook](#declared-drift-rules-__jac_schema__) and the runtime repairs old documents on load.

---

## What gets persisted

Every Jac archetype instance has a backing **anchor** that the runtime tracks. When an anchor is reachable from `root` (directly or via edges) and marked `persistent`, the runtime writes it to the configured storage backend on `commit()` (and at process exit).

```jac
node Person { has name: str; }

walker create {
    can s with Root entry {
        # Both nodes become persistent because they're attached to root.
        here ++> Person(name="alice");
        here ++> Person(name="bob");
    }
}
```

After `jac enter app.jac create`, alice and bob live in `.jac/data/<app>.db`. A subsequent `jac enter app.jac dump` (with a walker that traverses `[-->]`) sees them.

**Backends.** Out of the box, `SqliteMemory` writes to `.jac/data/<app>.db`. Configure a Mongo database under `[scale.*]` and set `MONGODB_URI`, then `jac install` pulls in `pymongo` and persistence flips to the [scale](plugins/jac-scale.md) `MongoBackend`. The storage swaps; the developer-facing model (this page) doesn't change.

---

## Concurrent writes: check-then-create and convergence

A common walker pattern is *find-or-create*: look something up, create it only if it's missing.

```jac
walker ensure_profile {
    can go with Root entry {
        profiles = [-->(?:UserProfile)];
        if profiles {
            report profiles[0];
        } else {
            here ++> UserProfile(tier="free");   # only when missing
        }
    }
}
```

Under concurrency this is a race: two requests against the same `root` can both read an empty `[-->(?:UserProfile)]`, both take the create branch, and both attach a profile -- a duplicate that was meant to be unique. The runtime closes this race with **optimistic concurrency at the node level**, so the pattern above is safe without app-level locks.

**How it works.** Every node carries a version. When a request reads an out-traversal from a node (the `[-->(?:UserProfile)]` above), it snapshots that node's version. At commit, an edge-list change to a node the request *read* is applied with a compare-and-swap on that version: if a concurrent request already changed the node, the swap misses and the commit raises a conflict. The first committer wins; the second is rejected before it can write a duplicate.

**Convergence (default).** A rejected request does not error. The server aborts its uncommitted work, reloads the node, and **replays the walker (or function) from the start**. The replay re-reads the graph -- now containing the winner's node -- takes the *find* branch, and returns normally. Two racing find-or-creates converge on one node; the client sees a normal `200`, not a duplicate and not an error.

**The losing unit of work is atomic.** A walker's writes are staged child-node-first, then its edge, then the edge-list link onto the parent that carries the compare-and-swap -- so a naive flush could persist the loser's child *before* the link fails, stranding it. The runtime does not allow that:

- On **SQLite** (the default local store), `apply()` runs the whole unit in one transaction and **rolls it back** on a conflict. A lost race leaves the store byte-for-byte unchanged -- no orphan.
- On **Mongo** (multi-pod), there is no cross-document rollback, so `apply()` runs a **version precheck before staging any write**: a read-gated node whose stored version already moved aborts the unit before the child/edge docs are written. The common case (the winner committed first) leaves no orphan. In the narrow window where the winner commits *during* the loser's `apply()`, the in-line CAS still rejects the link, leaving the loser's child reachable only by a *half-linked* edge (cited by the child, refused by the parent). That residual is invisible to traversal and is reclaimed by [`jac db fsck`](cli/index.md#database-operations), which now sweeps half-linked edges and the nodes they strand.

**Blind appends stay lock-free.** The compare-and-swap only fires on nodes the request *read*. A walker that appends without first reading -- `here ++> LogEntry(...)` with no preceding `[-->...]` -- takes no dependency, so concurrent appends to the same node merge instead of serializing. Only check-then-create pays the conflict-and-replay cost, and only on the node it actually checked.

**Side effects and replay: `on_commit`.** Because a losing request replays from scratch, an *external* side effect in the body (charging a card, sending mail, registering a token) would otherwise run more than once. Defer such effects with the `on_commit(...)` ambient builtin (no import needed): it registers a callback that runs only after the unit of work commits successfully, and is discarded on abort/replay -- so it fires exactly once, for the attempt that wins.

```jac
walker me {
    can go with Root entry {
        if not [-->(?:UserProfile)] {
            new = here ++> UserProfile(tier="free");
            on_commit(lambda () { grant_signup_bonus(new); });   # once, post-commit
        }
    }
}
```

**Configuration.** The policy is set in [`jac.toml`](config/index.md#serve) under `[serve]`:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `on_conflict` | `"retry"` | `"retry"` converges via replay; `"fail"` returns a typed `409 write_conflict` immediately (for clients that handle conflicts themselves) |
| `conflict_max_attempts` | `5` | Max attempts under `"retry"` before giving up with a `409` |
| `conflict_backoff_ms` | `0` | Linear backoff (ms x attempt) between replay attempts |

**Scope.** Conflict detection lives in the `MongoBackend` and `SqliteMemory` backends, so it holds on both the local SQLite store and a multi-pod Mongo deployment. Granularity is per node: two *different* find-or-creates on the same node (say a `UserProfile` and a `Settings` both attached to `root`) may each trigger one extra replay even though they don't truly duplicate -- harmless, since the replay re-confirms and proceeds.

---

## The schema fingerprint

Every archetype class carries a stable schema fingerprint at runtime:

```jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
    has age: int = 0;
}

with entry {
    print(Person.__jac_fingerprint__);  # e.g. "2231007f4104e5bd"
}
```

The fingerprint is a SHA-256 hash of `(module, class_name, sorted [(field_name, type_repr)])`, truncated to 16 hex chars. Two important properties:

1. **Same schema → same fingerprint.** Two runs of the same code produce identical fingerprints.
2. **Different schema → different fingerprint.** Add a field, remove a field, change a type -- the fingerprint changes.

```jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
    has age: int = 0;
    has email: str = "";  # ← added
}
# Person.__jac_fingerprint__ = "dd9dfc47a9284086"  (was 2231007f4104e5bd)
```

Every persisted row (or document) is **stamped with the fingerprint at save time**. On load, the runtime compares the stored fingerprint against the live class's current fingerprint:

- **Match** → fast path, deserialize normally.
- **Mismatch** → log a drift notice at INFO and proceed with best-effort load (next sections).

You don't write fingerprint code. The runtime does it. Fingerprints are how the persistence layer detects "the schema changed since this row was saved" without you telling it.

---

## Schema drift tolerance

For the common 80% of schema changes, the runtime handles drift transparently.

### Added field with a default

```jac
# v1                       # v2
node Person {              node Person {
    has name: str;             has name: str;
                               has email: str = "x@y";  # new
}                          }
```

On reload of v1-stored data with v2 code: `name` comes through unchanged, `email` takes its declared default. No warning, no quarantine.

### Removed field

Stored data has `age: 30`, the live class no longer declares `age`. The stale value doesn't leak onto the rehydrated archetype as an undeclared attribute -- instead it's **preserved in the attic**, a `__jac_attic__` sub-document that rides along with the row (see [The attic](#the-attic-nothing-is-destroyed)). Subsequent saves carry the attic forward, so the value remains recoverable. (Under `JAC_SCHEMA_REPAIR=off` or `detect`, the legacy behavior applies: the value is silently dropped.)

### Renamed field

Without a declaration, a rename looks like "remove old + add new with default" -- the old value lands in the attic and the new field takes its default. To make the old value flow into the new field, declare the rename with [`schema_alias`](#declared-drift-rules-__jac_schema__):

```jac
impl Person.__jac_schema__ -> None {
    schema_alias("name", stored="username");
}
```

### Type changed

Handled by the **coercion table**. `Serializer.coerce(value, target_type)` runs on every field during deserialization and converts the stored value to the live class's declared type:

| From | To | Notes |
|------|----|----|
| `str` | `int` / `float` / `bool` | bool parses `"true"`/`"1"`/`"yes"` and `"false"`/`"0"`/`"no"` |
| `int` / `float` / `bool` | `str` | `str(value)` |
| `int` ↔ `float` ↔ `bool` | each other | standard Python casts |
| `str` (ISO format) | `datetime` / `date` / `time` | `fromisoformat` |
| `str` | `UUID` | `UUID(value)` |
| value | `Enum` | by value, falls back to by-name lookup |
| `list` ↔ `tuple` | each other | shallow conversion |
| `None` | `T \| None` | passes through; non-`None` coerces against `T` |

If a field is declared as `A \| B \| C`, the coercer tries each variant in order and accepts the first that succeeds.

When coercion **fails** (e.g. `str("abc")` → `int`), the raw stored value is kept, a debug-level log is emitted, and the anchor still loads. Downstream code that uses the field will see the wrong type and may fail at use site -- but no data is lost. (This bias toward "load with bad value" over "block load" is deliberate; you can always inspect the row with `jac db quarantine show` if you've forced it into quarantine via stricter validation, but the default is to keep the data alive.)

---

## Quarantine, never delete

Some changes can't be auto-handled:

- The archetype class was renamed or moved (and no alias is registered).
- The stored data is corrupt JSON.
- A required field is missing and has no default.
- The Serializer raises during reconstruction.

In every such case, the row is **moved to a quarantine sidecar**:

- SQLite: `anchors_quarantine` table.
- MongoDB: `<collection>_quarantine` collection.

The quarantine row carries the full original payload, the timestamp, the error message, and the source format version. **Nothing is ever silently deleted** -- that's the contract. Inspect with `jac db quarantine list` / `jac db quarantine show <id>`. Recover (after you fix the cause) with `jac db recover` / `jac db recover-all`.

On the Mongo backend, quarantined documents additionally carry a machine-readable `reason_code` and are [auto-retried at startup](#scale-lazy-read-repair-and-self-healing-quarantine) when a new deploy plausibly fixes them.

If you've used Jac before and remember "delete `.jac/data/` to run again after editing a node," that workflow is no longer required. Schema edits don't wipe data; they at worst move data to quarantine where you can rescue it.

---

## Dangling references and read-path healing

Quarantine handles a document that *exists* but can't be loaded. A **dangling reference** is the opposite failure: a document that cites another document which is *gone*. A node's edge list names an edge that no longer exists; an edge names an endpoint node that no longer exists.

Each graph mutation flushes as one [crash-atomic unit of work](#what-gets-persisted) in referential-integrity order, so a crash can only ever leave an unreferenced *orphan*, never a dangling reference. Danglers therefore come from history, not from new writes: data corrupted before that ordering shipped, or a backend bug. They still need handling, because the citing document is live and a naive traversal that touched the missing referent would raise on every read.

**The read path heals them automatically.** When a traversal resolves a reference whose target is genuinely gone, it does not raise. Instead it:

1. files the missing referent into the quarantine store under the `DANGLING_REF` reason code (so it surfaces in `jac db quarantine list`),
2. prunes the stale citation from the citing document, staged as a normal edge-list write so the repair persists on the request's commit -- even a read-only request self-heals,
3. skips the dead reference and continues, so the rest of the traversal returns normally.

`DANGLING_REF` is deliberately distinct from the recoverable reasons (class-missing, schema-drift, cascade). A recoverable quarantine is left untouched on the read path -- its citations stay intact so `jac db recover` can restore the connection once you fix the cause. Only a referent that is absent *everywhere* (no live row, no recoverable quarantine) is treated as a genuine dangler and healed. Direct attribute access on a stale handle still raises: that is a programmer error, not a storage state, and only graph traversal heals.

**`jac db fsck` is the offline backstop.** Read-path healing only fixes references a live request actually touches. `jac db fsck` scans the whole store for dangling references and orphans, and `jac db fsck repair` heals every dangler (filing it under `DANGLING_REF`) and collects orphan garbage in one transaction -- useful as a monitoring probe and for cleaning references no traversal has reached yet. See [CLI → `jac db fsck`](cli/index.md#jac-db-fsck).

---

## Class renames: the alias decorator

A renamed class is the most common reason rows go to quarantine: the stored row says `arch_module=__main__, arch_type=LegacyPerson`, but the live registry only has `__main__.Person`. Lookup fails, row quarantines.

The fix is the `@archetype_alias` decorator, an ambient Jac builtin (no import needed):

```jac
@archetype_alias("__main__.LegacyPerson")
node Person {
    has name: str;
}
```

At class-definition time the decorator records `"__main__.LegacyPerson" → "__main__.Person"` in `Serializer._aliases`. On the next load, `_get_class("__main__", "LegacyPerson")` misses in the main registry, finds the alias, and returns the new class. Deserialization proceeds against `Person`. The old data flows in.

**Stack the decorator** when a class has been renamed multiple times in its history:

```jac
@archetype_alias("v1.Person")
@archetype_alias("v2.Human")
node User {
    has name: str;
}
```

**The argument is the fully-qualified old name as it appeared in stored data** -- i.e. `__module__ + "." + __name__` of the class at the time it was persisted. For files imported via `jac enter app.jac`, the module is `__main__`.

### Code-resident vs. DB-resident aliases

The decorator above is **code-resident**: lives in source, travels through git, applies wherever the code runs. That's the normal path.

For emergency operator rescue without a code deploy, aliases can also be added directly to the database:

```bash
jac db alias add "__main__.LegacyPerson" "__main__.Person"
```

DB-resident aliases live in an `aliases` table (SQLite) or `<collection>_aliases` companion collection (Mongo, e.g. `_anchors_aliases` for the default `_anchors` collection) and are loaded into the same in-process `Serializer._aliases` map at backend connect time. After adding one, run `jac db recover-all --app app.jac` to retry any rows currently quarantined for that class.

---

## Declared drift rules: `__jac_schema__`

The drift tolerance above is automatic but generic: it can default a new field or coerce a type, but it can't know that `username` *became* `name`, or that a comma-separated string should now split into a `list[str]`. For changes that need intent, an archetype declares its stored-shape history in a `__jac_schema__` hook.

The hook uses Jac's decl/impl separation, so the model declaration shows only the *present* shape and the history lives in the impl file:

```jac
# models.jac -- only the present
node User {
    has name: str = "";
    has tags: list[str] = [];

    static def __jac_schema__ -> None;
}
```

```jac
# impl/models.impl.jac -- the ledger of the past
def split_tags(doc: dict) -> dict {
    doc["tags"] = [t.strip() for t in doc["tags"].split(",") if t.strip()];
    return doc;
}

impl User.__jac_schema__ -> None {
    schema_was("myapp.models.OldUser");       # class rename
    schema_alias("name", stored="username");  # field rename
    schema_drop("legacy_bio");                # removed field: preserve its remains
    schema_upgrade(
        split_tags,
        when=(lambda doc: dict : isinstance(doc.get("tags"), str))
    );
}
```

The four builders are ambient Jac builtins (no import needed) and are only callable inside an executing `__jac_schema__`:

| Builder | Declares | Effect on load |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| `schema_was(old_fqn)` | The class was previously `module.ClassName` | Stored rows under the old name resolve to this class (same machinery as `@archetype_alias`) |
| `schema_alias(new, stored=old)` | Field `new` was previously stored as `old` | Old key is renamed in place; the value flows into the new field (then coercion runs as usual). On save, the old name is also written as a shadow copy ([dual-write](#rolling-deploys-dual-write)) |
| `schema_drop(field)` | A deleted field may still exist in stored rows | Its stored value moves to the [attic](#the-attic-nothing-is-destroyed) instead of being dropped |
| `schema_upgrade(fn, when=pred)` | An arbitrary `dict -> dict` transform | `fn` runs on a copy of the raw stored dict when `pred(doc)` is true; it must return the full replacement dict and be idempotent |

Rules are **shape-matched, not version-matched**: there are no version integers to maintain. A rename applies to any stored row that still carries the old key and lacks the new one, which keeps repair robust when dev, staging, and production saw different intermediate schemas. Every rule application is idempotent, so re-repairing an already-repaired row is a no-op.

The engine runs in the core Serializer, **before** field deserialization -- so SQLite, Mongo, and any plugin backend repair identically, and coercion/defaults still apply to the repaired values afterward.

### Validation at startup

Rules are validated against the live `has` declarations when the class registers (i.e. at import time). Contradictions fail the app at startup, never silently mid-traffic:

- `schema_alias("name", stored="username")` requires `name` to be a declared field and `username` to *not* be one (if the old field still exists, nothing was renamed).
- `schema_drop("x")` requires `x` to not be declared (the rule is about a deleted field's stored remains).
- Two aliases can't share a stored name, and two aliases can't target the same field.
- Calling a builder outside `__jac_schema__` raises immediately.

Field rules are **inherited by subclasses** (they inherited the fields, so they inherit the fields' history); `schema_was` applies only to the defining class.

### The attic: nothing is destroyed

Repaired-away values are never deleted. Removed fields (declared via `schema_drop` or simply unknown to the current class) move into a `__jac_attic__` sub-document stored alongside the row:

```json
{ "name": "ada", "tags": ["math"],
  "__jac_attic__": { "legacy_bio": { "value": "...", "reason": "dropped" } } }
```

The attic round-trips through loads and saves -- including under `JAC_SCHEMA_REPAIR=off`, so an emergency rollback can never destroy previously preserved data. It persists until you explicitly clean it up (a future census-gated *contract* phase will automate this).

### Rolling deploys: dual-write

During a rolling deploy, old-version pods read the same database as new-version pods. To keep them working, every aliased field is **dual-written**: saves emit both `name` and `username` with the same value (on full saves and partial field updates alike), so old readers keep finding the field they know.

On load, a row with *both* keys is recognized as dual-written, not drifted: an equal shadow is stripped silently (no write-back churn), and a differing shadow -- an old pod wrote `username` against an already-upgraded row -- resolves deterministically: the new name wins and the conflicting value is preserved in the attic as `shadow-conflict`. Shadows persist until a future contract phase strips them.

### The kill switch: `JAC_SCHEMA_REPAIR`

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `repair` (default) | Rules applied, attic written, dual-write active |
| `detect` | Drift is detected and logged (`steps not applied: [...]`) but nothing is mutated -- a production dry-run |
| `off` | Legacy load behavior (no renames, no upgrades, no new atticing). Previously written attics still round-trip so data is never lost |

### scale: lazy read-repair and self-healing quarantine

With the [scale](plugins/jac-scale.md) Mongo backend, repair goes one step further:

- **Read-repair write-back.** When a load applies repair steps, the upgraded document is written back with compare-and-set on the originally stored fingerprint. A concurrent writer on an older app version cleanly wins the race; the document simply repairs again on its next read. The L2 Redis cache is invalidated on write-back. (SQLite repairs in memory on every load; the write-back optimization is Mongo-only.)
- **Quarantine reason codes.** Quarantined documents are stamped with a machine-readable `reason_code` -- `CLASS_MISSING`, `FIELD_RECONSTRUCT`, `DESER_ERROR`, or `CASCADE` -- visible via `jac db quarantine show`.
- **Startup auto-retry.** After a deploy registers its classes, aliases, and drift rules, the backend automatically re-attempts a capped batch of quarantined documents the deploy plausibly fixed (a `CLASS_MISSING` doc whose class now resolves, or any doc whose class now declares rules). Failed attempts increment a `retry_count` and give up loudly after 5. Deploy the fix and the data heals itself; `jac db recover-all` remains the manual override.

### Worked example: a field rename end to end

```jac
# app.jac (v1)
node Person {
    has username: str = "",
        bio: str = "";
}

with entry { root ++> Person(username="ada", bio="first programmer"); }
```

After running v1, rename the field and delete `bio` in v2, declaring both:

```jac
# app.jac (v2)
node Person {
    has name: str = "";

    static def __jac_schema__ -> None;
}

impl Person.__jac_schema__ -> None {
    schema_alias("name", stored="username");
    schema_drop("bio");
}

with entry {
    for p in [root -->] {
        print(f"{p.name} / attic: {p?.__jac_attic__}");
    }
}
```

```text
INFO - Serializer: repaired __main__.Person: ['rename username -> name', 'attic bio']
ada / attic: {'bio': {'value': 'first programmer', 'reason': 'dropped'}}
```

The old value flowed into the renamed field, the deleted field's value is preserved, and no row went anywhere near quarantine.

### Inspecting rules

`jac db schema rules` lists every registered rule (the app is imported first, so its `__jac_schema__` hooks run):

```text
Registered schema drift rules
[INFO] JAC_SCHEMA_REPAIR mode: repair
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ archetype       ┃ rule  ┃ detail           ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
│ __main__.Person │ alias │ username -> name │
│ __main__.Person │ drop  │ bio              │
└─────────────────┴───────┴──────────────────┘
```

## Backend portability

Everything above is **backend-agnostic**. The `PersistentMemory` interface defines the contract; both `SqliteMemory` and the built-in scale `MongoBackend` implement it, and so will any future plugin-provided backend (Postgres, DynamoDB, whatever).

That means the same set of guarantees holds regardless of where your data lives:

- Fingerprints are stamped on every persisted row/document.
- Drift detection runs on every load.
- [`__jac_schema__` drift rules](#declared-drift-rules-__jac_schema__) repair rows identically on every backend (the engine lives in the core Serializer, ahead of field deserialization).
- Quarantine sidecars exist for every backend.
- Aliases (both decorator and CLI-managed) work the same way.
- The `jac db` CLI talks to the live backend through the abstract interface -- same commands, same output, different storage underneath.

(Backend-specific extras layer on top: the Mongo backend adds read-repair write-back, quarantine reason codes, and startup auto-retry.)

For plugin authors implementing a custom backend, see [Plugin Authoring → Recipe 7: Custom persistence backends](plugin-authoring.md#recipe-7-custom-persistence-backends) for the eight methods you need to implement.

## Worked example: a survivable schema change

Starting code:

```jac
# app.jac (v1)
node Person {
    has name: str;
    has age: int = 0;
}

walker create {
    can s with Root entry {
        here ++> Person(name="alice", age=30);
        here ++> Person(name="bob", age=25);
    }
}

walker dump {
    can r with Root entry { visit [-->]; }
    can p with Person entry { print(f"{here.name}:{here.age}"); }
}
```

```bash
jac enter app.jac create
# (alice and bob persist)
```

Now edit the schema -- add a field, change `age` from `int` to `str`, rename the class -- all at once:

```jac
# app.jac (v2)

@archetype_alias("__main__.Person")
node Human {
    has name: str;
    has age: str = "unknown";   # was int
    has email: str = "x@y";     # new field
}

walker dump {
    can r with Root entry { visit [-->]; }
    can p with Human entry {
        print(f"{here.name}:{here.age}:{here.email}");
    }
}
```

```bash
jac enter app.jac dump
# alice:30:x@y   ← age coerced int→str, email defaulted, class resolved via alias
# bob:25:x@y
```

Three forms of drift handled automatically: class rename via alias, type change via coercion, new field via default.

---

## Inspecting and rescuing data

When something goes wrong (un-aliased rename, malformed stored value, an exception during deserialization), data ends up in quarantine. The full operator workflow:

```bash
# 1. See the state of the world.
jac db inspect --app app.jac

# 2. List what's quarantined.
jac db quarantine list --app app.jac

# 3. Show one row in full to understand why it failed.
jac db quarantine show <row-id-prefix> --app app.jac

# 4. Add a rescue alias if it's a class-rename problem.
jac db alias add "__main__.OldName" "__main__.NewName" --app app.jac

# 5. Re-attempt every quarantined row.
jac db recover-all --app app.jac

# 6. Scan for referential-integrity violations (dangling refs, orphans);
#    add `repair` to heal danglers and collect orphans.
jac db fsck --app app.jac
```

Full subcommand reference: [CLI → Database Operations](cli/index.md#database-operations). For the dangling-reference model behind step 6, see [Dangling references and read-path healing](#dangling-references-and-read-path-healing).

## Limitations

Currently out of scope (planned follow-on work):

- **Contract phase** -- attic data and dual-written shadow fields persist indefinitely; the census-gated cleanup that strips them once no old-version reader remains is future work. Until then they cost a little storage but are harmless.
- **Rename auto-inference** -- the runtime won't guess that a removed field and an added field of the same type are a rename; you declare it with `schema_alias`. (A schema registry that proposes such inferences is future work.)
- **Background sweep** -- repair is lazy (on read) plus startup auto-retry; cold documents that are never read stay at their old shape until touched. They repair correctly whenever that happens.
- **Compiler enforcement** -- there's no build-time lint yet that detects an undeclared breaking change against a schema lockfile.
- **Deep container coercion** -- `list[int] → list[str]` doesn't recurse into elements (a `schema_upgrade` callback covers this case today).
- **Redis cache parity** -- the L2 cache (`RedisBackend` in the scale subsystem) still uses pickle. Since it's a cache (the L3 backend is the source of truth), the impact is bounded; the same machinery could be ported when needed.

For arbitrary transforms the escape hatch is `schema_upgrade` -- a `dict -> dict` callback with full control over the raw stored document. If something still can't be expressed, the quarantine sidecar preserves the original payload for manual handling.
