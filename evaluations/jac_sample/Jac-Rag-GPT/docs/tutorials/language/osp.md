!!! warning "Graph Persistence Between Runs"
    `jac run` persists graph state to a `.jac/` directory. If you run an example multiple times, you may see duplicate nodes or `NodeAnchor ... is not a valid reference!` errors. To start fresh, clean the `.jac/` directory: `jac clean --all`

## What is Object-Spatial Programming?

Traditional OOP: Objects exist in isolation. You call methods to bring data to computation.

**Object-Spatial Programming (OSP):** Objects exist in a graph with explicit relationships. You send computation (walkers) to data.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph oop["Traditional OOP"]
        Obj["Object<br/>.method()"]
    end
    subgraph osp["Object-Spatial Programming"]
        N1["Node"] -->|Edge| N2["Node"]
        W1(["Walker visits<br/>and operates"]) -.-> N1
        W2(["Walker moves<br/>to connected nodes"]) -.-> N2
    end
```

## Nodes: Objects in Space

Nodes are classes that can be connected in a graph.

```jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
    has age: int;

    def greet() -> str {
        return f"Hi, I'm {self.name}!";
    }
}

with entry {
    # Create nodes (just like regular objects)
    alice = Person(name="Alice", age=30);
    bob = Person(name="Bob", age=25);

    # Use them like regular objects
    print(alice.greet());  # Hi, I'm Alice!
    print(bob.age);        # 25
}
```

**Key point:** Nodes are full-featured classes with methods, inheritance, etc. The graph capability is dormant until you connect them.

---

## Connecting Nodes

Use the `++>` operator to connect nodes:

```jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
}

with entry {
    alice = Person(name="Alice");
    bob = Person(name="Bob");
    carol = Person(name="Carol");

    # Connect to root (the default starting node)
    root ++> alice;
    root ++> bob;

    # Connect alice to carol
    alice ++> carol;
}
```

This creates a graph:

```mermaid
graph TD
    root --> alice
    root --> bob
    alice --> carol
```

---

## Edges: Named Relationships

Edges can carry data and have types:

```jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
}

edge Knows {
    has since: int;      # Year they met
    has strength: str;   # "close", "acquaintance"
}

with entry {
    alice = Person(name="Alice");
    bob = Person(name="Bob");

    # Connect with a typed edge
    alice +>: Knows(since=2020, strength="close") :+> bob;
}
```

### Edge Operators

| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `++>` | Connect with generic edge |
| `+>: EdgeType() :+>` | Connect with typed edge |
| `-->` | Query forward connections |
| `<--` | Query backward connections |
| `<-->` | Query both directions |

---

## Querying the Graph

Use spatial operators to navigate:

```jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
}

with entry {
    alice = Person(name="Alice");
    bob = Person(name="Bob");
    carol = Person(name="Carol");

    root ++> alice;
    alice ++> bob;
    alice ++> carol;

    # Query connections from root
    people = [root -->];  # All nodes connected to root
    print(len(people));   # 1 (alice)

    # Query from alice
    friends = [alice -->];  # [bob, carol]

    # Filter by type
    only_people = [root -->][?:Person];
}
```

### Query Syntax

```jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
}

edge Knows {
    has since: int;
}

def query_examples(src: Person, alice: Person) {
    # Basic queries
    [src -->];           # All forward connections
    [src <--];           # All backward connections
    [src <-->];          # Both directions

    # Type filtering
    [src -->][?:Person];           # Only Person nodes
    [src ->:Knows:->];             # Only via Knows edges
    [src ->:Knows:->][?:Person];   # Knows edges to Person nodes

    # Chained traversal
    [alice ->:Knows:-> ->:Knows:->];  # Friends of friends
}
```

---

## Walkers: Mobile Computation

**Naming:** `Root` (capitalized) is the type of the root node, used in ability declarations like `can X with Root entry`. `root` (lowercase) is the built-in instance, used in expressions like `root ++> node` or `root spawn Walker()`.

Walkers are objects that traverse the graph and execute abilities at each node.

```jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
    has visited: bool = False;
}

walker Greeter {
    can start with Root entry {
        visit [-->];  # Visit nodes connected to root
    }

    can greet with Person entry {
        print(f"Hello, {here.name}!");
        here.visited = True;
    }
}

with entry {
    alice = Person(name="Alice");
    bob = Person(name="Bob");

    root ++> alice;
    alice ++> bob;

    # Spawn walker at root
    root spawn Greeter();
}
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, Alice!
```

!!! warning "Walkers need explicit traversal"
    A walker spawned at `root` starts there but doesn't automatically visit connected nodes. You must include a `can start with Root entry { visit [-->]; }` ability to begin traversal. Without it, the walker sits at root and its node-specific abilities never fire.

Wait, why only Alice? Because the walker visits root first (via `start`), then visits Alice (via `greet`), but doesn't continue to Bob. The walker needs to be told to continue traversing.

---

## Walker Traversal with `visit`

Use `visit` to continue to connected nodes:

```jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
}

walker Greeter {
    can start with Root entry {
        visit [-->];  # Start by visiting nodes connected to root
    }

    can greet with Person entry {
        print(f"Hello, {here.name}!");
        visit [-->];  # Continue to all connected nodes
    }
}

with entry {
    alice = Person(name="Alice");
    bob = Person(name="Bob");
    carol = Person(name="Carol");

    root ++> alice;
    alice ++> bob;
    alice ++> carol;

    root spawn Greeter();
}
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!
Hello, Carol!
```

---

## Walker Context Variables

Inside a walker ability:

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `here` | The current node |
| `self` | The walker instance |
| `visitor` | Only defined in *node* abilities, where it names the visiting walker. Using it inside a walker ability is a runtime `NameError` |

```jac
node Room {
    has name: str;
}

walker Explorer {
    has rooms_visited: int = 0;

    can explore with Room entry {
        self.rooms_visited += 1;
        print(f"In {here.name}, visited {self.rooms_visited} rooms");
        visit [-->];
    }
}
```

---

## Reporting Results

Use `report` to collect results from walkers:

```jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
    has age: int;
}

walker FindAdults {
    can start with Root entry {
        visit [-->];
    }

    can check with Person entry {
        if here.age >= 18 {
            report here;  # Add to results
        }
        visit [-->];
    }
}

with entry {
    root ++> Person(name="Alice", age=30);
    root ++> Person(name="Bob", age=15);
    root ++> Person(name="Carol", age=25);

    result = root spawn FindAdults();

    print(f"Found {len(result.reports)} adults");
    for person in result.reports {
        print(f"  - {person.name}");
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Person(name='Alice', age=30)
Person(name='Carol', age=25)
Found 2 adults
  - Alice
  - Carol
```

The `report` keyword does two things: prints the value to the console, and stores it in `result.reports` for programmatic access.

---

## Stopping Early with `disengage`

Use `disengage` to immediately stop a walker's traversal -- useful when you've found what you're looking for:

```jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
    has age: int;
}

walker FindFirst {
    can start with Root entry {
        visit [-->];
    }

    can check with Person entry {
        if here.age >= 18 {
            report here;
            disengage;  # Stop immediately -- don't visit more nodes
        }
        visit [-->];
    }
}

with entry {
    root ++> Person(name="Alice", age=15);
    root ++> Person(name="Bob", age=25);
    root ++> Person(name="Carol", age=30);

    result = root spawn FindFirst();
    print(f"First adult: {result.reports[0].name}");
}
```

**Output:**

```
Person(name='Bob', age=25)
First adult: Bob
```

Without `disengage`, the walker would continue visiting Carol. With it, the walker stops as soon as it finds Bob. This is especially useful in search walkers where you need to find and modify a specific node (like toggling or deleting a task by ID).

---

## Entry Points

Walkers can have different entry points:

```jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
    has age: int;
}

walker DataProcessor {
    has data: str;

    # Runs when spawned at root
    can start with Root entry {
        print("Starting from root");
        visit [-->];
    }

    # Runs when visiting a Person node
    can process with Person entry {
        print(f"Processing {here.name}");
        visit [-->];
    }

    # Runs only at the spawn location -- a generic `with entry`
    # does NOT fire on every visited node
    can default with entry {
        print("At spawn location");
        visit [-->];
    }
}
```

---

## Practical Example: Social Network

```jac
node User {
    has username: str;
    has bio: str = "";
}

edge Follows {
    has since: str;
}

walker FindFollowers {
    can find with User entry {
        # Find all users who follow this user
        followers = [<-:Follows:<-];
        for follower in followers {
            report follower;
        }
    }
}

walker FindMutualFollows {
    can find with User entry {
        following = [here ->:Follows:->];
        followers = [here <-:Follows:<-];

        for user in following {
            if user in followers {
                report user;  # Mutual follow!
            }
        }
    }
}

with entry {
    alice = User(username="alice");
    bob = User(username="bob");
    carol = User(username="carol");

    root ++> alice;
    root ++> bob;
    root ++> carol;

    # Alice follows Bob, Bob follows Alice (mutual)
    alice +>: Follows(since="2024") :+> bob;
    bob +>: Follows(since="2024") :+> alice;

    # Carol follows Alice
    carol +>: Follows(since="2024") :+> alice;

    # Find Alice's followers
    result = alice spawn FindFollowers();
    print("Alice's followers:");
    for user in result.reports {
        print(f"  - {user.username}");
    }

    # Find Alice's mutual follows
    result = alice spawn FindMutualFollows();
    print("Alice's mutual follows:");
    for user in result.reports {
        print(f"  - {user.username}");
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
User(username='bob', bio='')
User(username='carol', bio='')
Alice's followers:
  - bob
  - carol
User(username='bob', bio='')
Alice's mutual follows:
  - bob
```

## Running as an API

The same graph code becomes a REST API:

```jac
node Todo {
    has title: str;
    has done: bool = False;
}

walker add_todo {
    has title: str;

    can create with Root entry {
        new_todo = here ++> Todo(title=self.title);
        report new_todo;
    }
}

walker list_todos {
    can list with Root entry {
        for todo in [-->][?:Todo] {
            report todo;
        }
    }
}
```

!!! note
    `main.jac` is the default entry point. If your file has a different name (e.g., `app.jac`), pass it explicitly: `jac start app.jac`.

```bash
# Run as API server
jac start

# Call via HTTP
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/walker/add_todo \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Learn OSP"}'
```

---

## When to Use Functions vs Walkers

Jac gives you two ways to expose server logic: `def:pub` functions and `walker` types.

| | `def:pub` Functions | Walkers |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Simple stateless CRUD, quick prototyping | Graph traversal, per-user data, production apps |
| **Auth** | Shared data (no user isolation) | Per-user root node (`walker:priv` enforces auth) |
| **Data access** | Direct: `[root -->]` | Traversal: `visit [-->]`, `here` |
| **API style** | Function call → HTTP endpoint | Spawn walker at node |
| **State** | Stateless | Carries state across nodes via `has` properties |

!!! tip "Rule of thumb"
    Start with `def:pub` to prototype quickly. Switch to walkers when you need authentication, per-user data isolation, or multi-step graph traversal.

The [AI Day Planner Tutorial](../first-app/build-ai-day-planner.md) uses `def:pub` in the early parts, then refactors to walkers in [Part 6](../first-app/build-ai-day-planner.md#part-6-multi-user-support) -- showing exactly when and why to make the switch.
