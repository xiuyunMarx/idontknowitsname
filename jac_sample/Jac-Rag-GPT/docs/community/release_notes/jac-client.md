# Jac-Client Release Notes

This document provides a summary of new features, improvements, and bug fixes in each version of **Jac-Client**. For details on changes that might require updates to your existing code, please refer to the [Breaking Changes](../breaking-changes.md) page.

## jac-client 0.3.25 (Latest Release)

### New Features

- **Client-only apps (`kind = "client"`)**: A project with `kind = "client"` is now auto-detected by `jac build` and `jac start` (no `--client static` flag needed). `jac build` inlines the JS bundle and CSS into a self-contained `index.html` that opens directly from disk (`file://`), and `jac start` serves it with a minimal static server (no API server, auth, or database) that still maps `/static/<name>.wasm` for `na`->wasm modules. The build flavor is also available explicitly as `--client static`; an explicit `--client` overrides the auto-detection.

## jac-client 0.3.24

### New Features

- **Feature: `fullstack` / `wasm` / `mobile` create kinds**: jac-client now contributes project-kind templates to the kind-aware `jac create`. `jac create --kind fullstack` scaffolds a server + client app, `--kind wasm` a client-only page (the former `client` template), and `--kind mobile` a mobile client app. Each stamps `[project] kind` so the project's bare `jac run` does the right thing.

## jac-client 0.3.23

### New Features

- **Feature: google-auth example wired to system-browser SSO**: The example's login and register buttons now drive the runtime's `jacSsoLogin()`, completing the previously missing `lib/auth` (AuthProvider/route guard) and storing the token under the canonical `jac_token` key so authenticated walker calls work. (jaseci-labs/jaseci#6485)

### Refactors

- **Examples drop redundant `cl` markers**: Bundled `.cl.jac` examples rely on the file extension for client context. (jaseci-labs/jaseci#6557)

## jac-client 0.3.22

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix: jac-client CLI output no longer prints raw Rich markup**: npm/bun install and config-loader messages use `console.print(..., style=)`, `console.warning`, `console.success`, and `console.error` so status lines render with correct colors on the default ANSI console.

### Refactors

- **Refactor: client plugin consumes the unified core build pipeline**: The jac-client plugin no longer ships its own copy of the bun installer, Vite bundler, and client config loader; these moved into `jaclang.runtimelib.client` so the web, pwa, mobile, and desktop targets all share one runtime and one bundler. The plugin and its targets now import these from core instead of `jac_client.plugin.src.*`. (jaseci-labs/jaseci#6390)
- **Refactor: Drop PyTauri-specific desktop handling**: Removed the `src-pytauri` setup detection/verification and the dead PyInstaller sidecar template from the client target plumbing. The `desktop` target (jac-desktop) is now a native webview build that needs no setup step.

## jac-client 0.3.20

### New Features

- **Feature: PyTauri desktop target**: The desktop build target now uses PyTauri instead of the Rust/Tauri CLI, so desktop apps no longer require a Cargo install; the PyTauri wheel bundles the Tauri runtime.
- **Feature: Plugin-provided client targets**: jac-client owns a dedicated runtime plugin surface (`JacClientPluginSpec.get_client_targets` on the `jac_client` entry-point group). Plugins such as `jac-desktop` contribute build targets without extending jaclang core; the desktop target and native sidecar register through that hook.
- **Feature: Desktop config under `[plugins.desktop]`**: Window, identifier, sidecar plugin bundling, Tauri plugins, and PyInstaller `extra_data` globs are configured under `[plugins.desktop]` (and nested `[plugins.desktop.window]`, `[plugins.desktop.plugins]`, `[plugins.desktop.bundle]`).

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix: Client error stacks resolve to the correct `.jac` line**: Per-file source maps for client modules were silently skipped during a fullstack/interop build because map generation re-fetched the module from the global hub, which such builds leave empty (client modules compile into a separate codespace). Without the map, a client-side JS error resolved to the compiled-JS line with the `.jac` filename swapped in, pointing at a line that does not exist in the source. Map generation now uses the module the compiler already produced, and also covers the client and PWA runtime files (which previously emitted no maps).
- **Fix: client function-name resolution spans both compiler programs**: The web target resolved a loaded module's compiled IR by reading `Jac.program.mod.hub` directly, which misses a jaclang-bundled app's modules (they compile into the internal program) and silently fell back to the default function name. It now resolves through the program-spanning `JacProgram.find_module`.

### Refactors

- **Refactor: One-line JSX returns across client examples and runtime**: Applied the updated formatter, collapsing short `return <Element/>;` statements onto a single line across the `jac-client` examples, fullstack template, and plugin runtime impls.

### Documentation

- **Docs: Desktop tutorial and reference**: Document PyTauri desktop setup, `[plugins.desktop]` configuration, and `jac desktop plugin` commands in the fullstack tutorial and [jac-desktop reference](../../reference/plugins/jac-desktop.md).

## jac-client 0.3.18

### New Features

- **`JacAwaiting` runtime shim**: New ambient `JacAwaiting(props)` view declaration in `client_runtime.cl.jac` -- a thin `React.Suspense` wrapper that the compiler targets when lowering `try { ... } awaiting { ... }` clauses on the `cl` target.

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix: `undefined` JSX children no longer crash the page**: A `cl` component that forwards a missing or optional prop as a JSX child (e.g. `{props.maybe}` when `maybe` isn't passed) now renders cleanly instead of blanking the page with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '__jacUnsafeHtml')`.
- **Fix: reading client config no longer mutates non-client projects' `jac.toml`**: `JacClientConfig.load()` previously injected the client's npm dependency set (react, vite, typescript, …) and rewrote `jac.toml` as a side effect of merely reading client config, so any backend-only project that booted the API server gained a `[dependencies.npm]` section and had its file reserialized. The self-healing dependency migration/injection is now gated on the project having explicitly opted into the client via a `[plugins.client]` section; real client projects still self-heal as before.

### Refactors

- **Refactor: read base path via `Jac.get_base_path_dir()`**: Migrated to the new accessor; the prior `Jac.base_path_dir` class attribute has been removed.
- **Leaner fullstack starter template**: The `jac create` fullstack template is trimmed to a simpler message-based example -- the todo-app scaffolding (AuthForm, Button, TodoItem components and the template README) is removed in favor of a single MessageCard component with reworked `frontend`, `endpoints`, and `main`.

## jac-client 0.3.14

### New Features

- **Feature: Mobile target with Capacitor (Android + iOS)**: Adds `jac build --client mobile`, `jac start --client mobile`, and `jac setup mobile` -- wraps the Jac client (Vite) web app in a Capacitor native shell. Reuses the WebTarget pipeline for HTML/JS/CSS; auto-selects the dev host for Android emulator (10.0.2.2), iOS Simulator (127.0.0.1), and LAN for physical devices; supports HMR via Vite + Capacitor live-reload; checks Android/iOS toolchain prerequisites; auto-configures `adb reverse` for USB-connected Android devices. Closes #5460.

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix: Desktop sidecar bundles all PyPI dependencies correctly**: PyPI packages whose installation name differs from their import name no longer get silently dropped from the frozen desktop sidecar. `.jac` source files shipped inside Python packages are bundled alongside the `.py` files.
- **Fix: Correct assert string in `test_client_only_requires_base_url`**: The test was checking for `"client_only = true requires"` which never existed in the implementation. Updated to match the actual error message `"client_only mode requires"` in `desktop_target.impl.jac`.
- **Fix: `jacSignup` surfaces JSON parse errors instead of swallowing them**: On a 200 response with a malformed body, `jacSignup` previously returned `{success: True, user_id: None}`, hiding the failure from callers. It now returns `{success: False, error: ...}` when the response body cannot be parsed as JSON.
- **jac-client: Multi-segment SPA routes**: Fixed an issue where asset paths (JS/CSS) in the generated `index.html` were relative, causing 404 errors when refreshing on nested routes. Asset paths now use a configurable `base_path` (defaulting to `/`), which also enables deploying the app on a subpath.
- **Fix: use `{**field}` instead of `{...field}` in JacForm input JSX**: jac-client's form-input components spread the `react-hook-form` `field` registration into JSX with `{...field}`, which is JS-idiomatic but emits W0063 (`prefer-double-star-spread`) once the type checker reaches them. Switched to Jac's `{**field}` so the lint stays clean as `@jac/runtime` consumers gain stricter type checking. No runtime behavior change.

### Refactors

- **Refactor: Convert `.map(lambda)` to JSX List Comprehension in Client Runtime**: Replaced `.map(lambda → JSX)` patterns in `client_runtime.impl.jac` with native Jac JSX list comprehension syntax (`[<jsx> for item in collection]`), aligning the runtime code with idiomatic Jac style.

## jac-client 0.3.13

### New Features

- **Examples: useState → `has` Declaration Migration**: Updated `all-in-one` and `full-stack-with-auth` examples to replace React `useState` hooks with Jac-native `has` declarations. Setter callbacks passed as JSX props (e.g. `setFilter`, `setInput`) are now expressed as inline lambdas (`lambda val: str -> str { x = val; }`). The `useLocalStorage` hook was refactored to use `useEffect` for the initial localStorage load, replacing the unsupported lazy-initializer pattern.
- **Perf: Skip PyInstaller `--clean` for Faster Incremental Sidecar Builds**: The PyInstaller invocation for the desktop sidecar no longer passes `--clean`, so incremental rebuilds reuse the previous build cache instead of wiping it on every run. This significantly cuts rebuild time during iterative development. Use `jac clean` if a fully fresh build is ever needed.
- **Feat: Generate All Platform Icons for Desktop Bundles**: `_generate_default_icons` now produces all icon formats Tauri needs: `icon.ico` (Windows NSIS/MSI), `icon.icns` (macOS .app), and standard PNG sizes (`32x32.png`, `128x128.png`, `128x128@2x.png`, `256x256.png`) for Linux. Previously only `icon.png` was generated, causing `cargo tauri build` to fail on Windows (missing `.ico`) and macOS (missing `.icns` / `No matching IconType`). Uses Pillow in-process with a subprocess fallback. Warns if Pillow is unavailable.
- **Feat: Bundle Extra Data Files via `[desktop.bundle] extra_data`**: `jac.toml` now accepts a `[desktop.bundle] extra_data` array of glob patterns that the PyInstaller spec will include in the sidecar bundle. Patterns are rooted at the project directory, and matches keep their relative path inside the bundle so `Path(__file__).parent / "config/prompts.yaml"` still resolves at runtime. Useful for shipping config files, YAML schemas, seed data, and anything else the sidecar needs at runtime but that isn't picked up by `[dependencies]`.
- **Feat: `jac setup desktop` prints install instructions instead of running sudo**: When a required dependency is missing (Rust toolchain, build tools, webkit/gtk system libraries, Xcode Command Line Tools, Visual Studio Build Tools), the setup command now prints the exact platform-specific install command and tells the user to re-run `jac setup desktop`. Previously it would pipe `curl | sh` for rustup, run `sudo apt-get/dnf/pacman install` for system packages, and invoke `xcode-select --install` behind a `[Y/n]` prompt. User-space installs (`pip install jaclang`, `cargo install tauri-cli`) still prompt since they don't escalate privileges.
- **Feat: `jacLogin`/`jacSignup` accept typed identity/credential inputs**: `jacLogin(identity, credential)` accepts either `(username, password)` strings or `(identity_dict, credential_dict)` with explicit `{type, value}` / `{type, password}` shapes. `jacSignup(identities, credential)` accepts either `(username, password)` strings or `(identities_list, credential)` for multi-identity registration, e.g. `jacSignup([{"type": "username", "value": "alice"}, {"type": "email", "value": "alice@x.com"}], password)`. Internally both paths send the new `{identity, credential}` / `{identities, credential}` wire payload that jaclang and jac-scale servers speak.
- **Feat: `jacSignup` accepts an optional `profile` argument**: `jacSignup(identities, credential, profile?)` now takes an optional third arg, a `profile` dict forwarded to `POST /user/register` for fields like firstname, lastname, address, postcode. The profile is omitted from the request body when null. On success the helper returns `{success: True, user_id}` without a token; the caller must call `jacLogin` separately to start an authenticated session, matching the server contract that `/user/register` does not issue tokens. To read the profile, call `GET /user/me` directly with the Bearer token.
- **Error boundary reports React componentStack**: When a render error originates deep inside react-dom, the default `ErrorBoundary` now forwards React's `componentStack` alongside the JS error so the server can pinpoint the user component (and `.jac` file) that triggered the crash.

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix: Windows PyInstaller Sidecar Support (onedir + UTF-8 + multiprocessing)**: Reworked the PyInstaller spec and sidecar entry point to produce working Windows desktop builds. (1) **Onedir mode**: The sidecar is now bundled with `EXE(exclude_binaries=True)` + `COLLECT(...)` instead of onefile; onefile hangs at startup on Windows + Python 3.13 due to temp-extraction issues, and onedir starts faster on all platforms. (2) **UTF-8 runtime hook**: A generated `rthook_utf8.py` is wired into the spec via `runtime_hooks=[...]` and sets `PYTHONUTF8=1` before any stdlib import, eliminating charmap codec errors on Windows consoles. (3) **Multiprocessing freeze support**: The generated entry script now calls `multiprocessing.freeze_support()` on Windows and the spec's `hiddenimports` include `multiprocessing`, `multiprocessing.pool`, `multiprocessing.process`, `multiprocessing.spawn`, and `multiprocessing.popen_spawn_win32` so the spawn start method can re-execute the frozen binary. (4) **Tauri integration**: `_add_sidecar_to_config` detects the onedir `binaries/jac-sidecar/` folder and adds `binaries/jac-sidecar/**/*` to `bundle.resources`; `find_and_start_sidecar` in the Rust template checks `binaries/jac-sidecar/jac-sidecar(.exe)` first before falling back to onefile/wrapper paths.
- **Fix: Windows Data Path + Skip `cc` Build-Tool Check on Windows**: The Tauri `main.rs` template now computes the sidecar `--data-path` using `LOCALAPPDATA` (falling back to `USERPROFILE\AppData\Local`) on Windows, mirroring the existing `HOME/.local/share/jac-app` path on Unix. The generated code wraps the two branches in `#[cfg(windows)]` / `#[cfg(not(windows))]` so only the platform-appropriate variant compiles. `_run_tauri_dev` also skips the `cc --version` build-tools probe on `win32`: `cc` is not a standard command on Windows (MSVC handles native compilation via VS Build Tools) and the probe failed on correctly configured machines.
- **Fix: Static Asset Loading on Port 8000**: Added missing `/assets` proxy to the Vite dev server configuration. This ensures that static assets (images, etc.) stored in the project's `assets/` directory load correctly on port 8000 during development mode (`jac start --dev`).
- **Fix: Add `client_only` to `DesktopConfig.get_default_config()`**: `client_only` was missing from the dict returned by `get_default_config()` even though `is_client_only()` and its test were both added in #5494. The key is now included with a default of `False`, matching the behaviour of `is_client_only()` and satisfying the existing `test_client_only_config_is_supported` test.

### Refactors

- **Fullstack template uses bare `root`**: `frontend.impl.jac` in the fullstack template now uses bare `root spawn ...` instead of `root() spawn ...`, matching the canonical syntax after `root` is restored as a `SpecialVarRef` keyword.

### Documentation

- **Docs: `auth-calling-forms` example**: New `examples/auth-calling-forms` demo showing `jacLogin`/`jacSignup` called with both the backward-compatible bare-string form and the new identity/credential (dict/list) form. Also exercised end-to-end by the jac-client Playwright suite against both the jaclang and jac-scale backends.

## jac-client 0.3.12

- **Jacpack Template Migration to `to cl:`**: The `client` scaffold's `main.jac` now uses the flatter `to cl:` section-header form instead of wrapping the entire component in a `cl { ... }` block.
- **Jacpack Template Cleanup**: The `client` and `fullstack` scaffolds drop their leftover React usage, return `JsxElement` from their component roots, and use idiomatic Jac state/effect/event patterns so freshly-created projects pass `jac check` out of the box.
- **Feat: Multi-mode Sidecar for Windows Desktop**: --jac-cli flag for CLI proxy, manual plugin registration for frozen apps, .env loading from bundled location, UTF-8/NO_COLOR for Windows.
- **Desktop Plugin Bundling Config**: Added `get_plugins_config()` to `DesktopConfig` for reading the `[desktop.plugins]` section from `jac.toml`, controlling which Jac plugins (jac-scale, byllm, jac-coder) are bundled into desktop apps.
- **Fix: Sidecar Stdout Crash on Windows Desktop**: Redirect `sys.stdout` to `sys.stderr` after writing `JAC_SIDECAR_PORT` to Tauri. Tauri drops the stdout pipe after reading the port, causing subsequent `console.print()` and `sys.stdout.flush()` calls to crash with `OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument`.
- **Feat: Client-Only Mode for Desktop Builds**: Added `client_only` build mode that builds only the web client bundle without the full Tauri app, useful for development and CI workflows.
- **Fix: JAC_BUILD Env Var During Desktop Build**: Set `JAC_BUILD=1` environment variable during desktop build to prevent the Jac server from starting during compilation, avoiding port conflicts and unnecessary resource usage.
- **Fix: Always Bundle jac_client as Core Sidecar Package**: `jac_client` is now bundled as a core package in PyInstaller builds regardless of `[desktop.plugins]` config, since the sidecar entry point depends on it. Previously, setting `jac_client = false` in plugins config would break the sidecar at startup with `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- **Fix: Exclude Build Artifacts from PyInstaller .jac Collection**: The `rglob('*.jac')` in the PyInstaller spec now skips `src-tauri`, `node_modules`, `dist`, and other build artifact directories. Previously, rebuilding would recursively nest previous sidecar bundles, creating deeply nested paths that exceeded Windows path limits and broke NSIS installer generation.
- **Fix: Add jac_mcp to Default Desktop Plugin Config**: Added `jac_mcp` to the default `[desktop.plugins]` configuration so MCP server integration is bundled by default in desktop builds.
- **Fix: Vite Define Skips Empty API URL**: The Vite config no longer injects `__JAC_API_BASE_URL__: undefined` when no API URL is configured, preventing conflicts with Tauri's runtime injection in desktop builds.
- **Fix: HTML Script Tag Escaping**: Fixed `</script>` sequences in JSON payloads within `<script>` tags being incorrectly interpreted as tag closers by escaping `</` to `<\/`.
- **Desktop Sidecar Overhaul**: Complete rewrite of sidecar process management with signal handling (`SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`/`SIGHUP`), stderr redirect (`JAC_USE_STDERR=1`) to avoid `BrokenPipeError` after Tauri closes stdout, writable data path (`--data-path` / `JAC_DATA_PATH`) for read-only AppImage environments with fallback probing, and manual plugin registration for PyInstaller-frozen apps.
- **Runtime API URL Injection for Desktop**: Desktop builds no longer embed `__JAC_API_BASE_URL__` at compile time. Instead, Tauri injects the sidecar URL into the webview via `initialization_script` after discovering the dynamically allocated port. Added `get_api_url` Tauri command as fallback for timing edge cases.
- **AppImage Environment Support**: Generated Rust code removes AppImage-injected `PYTHONHOME`/`PYTHONPATH`/`PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE` variables that break bundled Python, and looks up `main.jac` in bundled Tauri resources before searching parent directories.
- **Bundled Jac Sources for Desktop**: Desktop builds now copy all `.jac` files, `jac.toml`, and `assets/` directory into `src-tauri/jac/` as Tauri bundle resources, enabling fully self-contained desktop distributions.
- **Desktop Target Refactoring**: Extracted constants (`DEFAULT_API_PORT`, `SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT_*`, `DEFAULT_WINDOW_*`) and helper functions (`_check_command_available`, `_is_fuse_error`, `_join_path`) to reduce duplication. Fixed `platform` parameter shadowing.
- **Standalone Sidecar Bundling via PyInstaller**: Desktop builds now bundle the Jac sidecar as a standalone executable using PyInstaller by default. The bundled sidecar includes Python, jaclang, jac-client, and configured plugins (jac-scale, byllm, jac-coder via `[desktop.plugins]` in `jac.toml`), eliminating the requirement for end users to have Python installed. Auto-installs Python dependencies from `jac.toml` before bundling. Set `JAC_SIDECAR_STANDALONE=0` to fall back to wrapper script mode.
- **Debug Diagnostic Page**: Added a debug page to the all-in-one example app for diagnosing sidecar/API connectivity issues. Displays API base URL status, Tauri runtime detection, `get_api_url` invoke results, and interactive buttons to test walker spawning and direct HTTP fetch.
- **Plugin Reference Docs**: Added `reference/plugins/jac-client.md` documenting jac-client CLI commands and configuration options.
- 5 small refactors/changes.

## jac-client 0.3.11

- **Replace npm meta-packages with direct dependencies**: Removed `jac-client-node` and `@jac-client/dev-deps` meta-packages in favor of injecting individual npm dependencies (react, vite, typescript, etc.) directly into `jac.toml`. Users can now see and pin exact dependency versions. Existing projects using meta-packages are automatically migrated on next load.
- **Improved Error Visibility**: Build and runtime errors that were previously silenced now surface as warnings in the terminal and browser console, making it easier to diagnose issues during development and production.
- 2 small refactors/changes.

## jac-client 0.3.8

- **Auto-install Bun to .jac/bin/**: Bun is now automatically downloaded and managed inside the project's `.jac/bin/` directory when not found on the system PATH. No global install required, no interactive prompts, no PATH configuration needed. All callers resolve the bun binary via `get_bun()` which returns the absolute path directly, bypassing PATH entirely. Pinned to Bun v1.3.11 with automatic upgrades when the pinned version changes.

## jac-client 0.3.10

- **Dev Mode: API Docs accessible from client URL**: The Vite dev server now proxies `/docs`, `/redoc`, `/openapi.json`, `/admin`, and `/graph` to the API backend, so developers can access all dev tools from the client URL without switching ports.
- **Fix: Windows Client Compilation and Page Routing**: Fixed multiple Windows-specific issues preventing client apps from compiling and running. (1) **Path normalization**: Module hub lookups now use cross-platform path comparison, handling Windows case-insensitivity and backslash separators. (2) **JS generation**: The ES pass is now explicitly triggered when generated JavaScript is empty, fixing page files compiling to empty output. (3) **Import paths**: Backslashes are now normalized to forward slashes in generated JavaScript imports, fixing Vite build errors like `"page" is not exported`. These fixes are no-ops on Linux/macOS where paths already work correctly.

## jac-client 0.3.9

- **Updated Examples to Use Typed Interop Pattern**: The `basic-full-stack`, `full-stack-with-auth`, and `little-x` examples now use the typed object hydration pattern (`__from_wire`/`__to_wire`) for server/client communication.
- **Simplified WebTarget Production Preview**: The `start` command for web targets now uses a simple HTTP file server for production preview instead of instantiating a full API server, reducing dependencies and startup complexity.
- **Jac-Scale Plugin Support for PWA/Web Targets**: Fixed `WebTarget.start()` to use `Jac.get_api_server_class()` plugin hook instead of Python's built-in `http.server`. When jac-scale is installed, `jac start --client pwa` and `jac start --client web` now automatically use jac-scale's FastAPI-based server with JWT authentication, user management, WebSocket support, and admin portal. Previously, these targets ignored jac-scale and always used the basic HTTP server.

## jac-client 0.3.8

## jac-client 0.3.7

- **PWA Install Banner**: PWA apps now show an automatic install prompt after `jac setup pwa` -- no manual code required. Features include a glassmorphic dark banner with slide-up animation, native Chrome/Edge install prompt integration via `beforeinstallprompt`, iOS Safari support with step-by-step "Add to Home Screen" instructions modal, and smart re-prompting with exponential backoff (7 → 14 → 28 days, max 3 dismissals). All banner settings are configurable via `[plugins.client.pwa]` in `jac.toml`: `install_banner`, `install_banner_delay`, `install_banner_position`, `install_button_text`, `install_dismiss_text`. For programmatic control, import `usePwaInstall` hook or `PwaInstallButton` component from `@jac/pwa`.
- **Vite dev server binds to all interfaces**: Added `host: true` to Vite config and `--host` CLI flag so the dev server is accessible from outside containers/pods.
- **Client-Side Error Reporting**: Added `__jacReportError` and `__jacInstallErrorHandlers` to the client runtime. Global error handlers (`window.onerror`, `unhandledrejection`) are installed at app initialization to automatically capture unhandled JS errors and forward them to the server via `POST /cl/__error__`. The `ErrorBoundary` fallback component also reports caught errors. Entry file generation (`ViteCompiler`) now imports and calls `__jacInstallErrorHandlers()` on startup for both explicit and pages-based routing modes.
- **Per-File Source Map Generation**: The client compiler now generates `.js.map` files for each compiled `.jac` module, mapping generated JS lines back to original `.jac` source locations. Source comment headers (`/* Source: path.jac */`) are paired with standard v3 source maps for full traceability.
- **Diagnostics Source Map Auto-Population**: `BuildContext` now auto-populates its source map from compiled JS `/* Source: */` headers when none is provided, and delegates snippet reading to the centralized `source_mapping` module.
- **Vite Source Map Chaining**: The `jac-source-mapper` Vite plugin now loads per-file `.js.map` files and returns them as input source maps during `transform`, enabling Vite/Rollup to chain `.jac` → compiled `.js` → bundled `client.js` mappings end-to-end.

## jac-client 0.3.6

- **Fix: Desktop Target Asset Loading**: Fixed an issue where images and other static assets referenced with `/static/assets/` URLs were not loading in desktop (Tauri) builds. Assets are now correctly copied from `compiled/assets/` to `dist/static/assets/` during the build process, ensuring they are available when Tauri serves the frontend bundle. This fix applies to both `jac build --client desktop` and `jac start --client desktop` commands.

## jac-client 0.3.5

- **ESM & TypeScript Client Config Generation**: Added a feature to support for generating ESM and TypeScript client config files from `[plugins.client.configs]`, while preserving existing CommonJS behavior and allowing raw config templates when needed.
- **Fix: Parser Strictness Compliance**: Moved docstrings before signatures across all test files (`test_cli`, `test_it`, `test_e2e`, `test_helpers`, `test_desktop_api_url`) and backtick-escaped `entry`/`walker` keyword parameters in `client_runtime` to comply with the stricter RD parser.
- **Auto-Manage Core npm Dependencies**: The client config loader now automatically adds `jac-client-node` and `@jac-client/dev-deps` to `jac.toml` if missing, and auto-updates them when version mismatches are detected. When dependencies change, `node_modules` is cleared to force reinstall. Added `check_runtime_version()` and `sync_runtime_version()` methods for programmatic version management.

## jac-client 0.3.4

- **HMR Client Error Reporting**: Client-side runtime and module import errors now reported to terminal via Vite WebSocket.
- Internal: updated jac.toml of all-in-one example to use redis dashboard and mongodb dashboard
- 3 Minor refactors/changes.

## jac-client 0.3.3

## jac-client 0.3.2

- **Chore: Codebase Reformatted**: All `.jac` files reformatted with improved `jac format` (better line-breaking, comment spacing, and ternary indentation).
- 1 small refactor/change

## jac-client 0.3.1

- **Form Handling:** Introduced `jacForm` hook for comprehensive form state management, `JacSchema` for type-safe form validation with custom rules and cross-field logic.
- **Admin Portal UI Components**: Added reusable UI components for the jac-scale admin portal including buttons, modals, inputs, tables, and layout components built with jac-client.
- **Custom Import Path Aliases via jac.toml**: Added support for configuring import path aliases in `[plugins.client.paths]`. Define aliases like `"@components/*" = "./components/*"` and they are automatically applied to the generated Vite `resolve.alias` and TypeScript `compilerOptions.paths` in tsconfig.json.
- **NPM Scoped Registry & Auth Support via jac.toml**: Added support for configuring custom npm registries and authentication tokens directly in `jac.toml` under `[plugins.client.npm]`.

## jac-client 0.3.0

- **Idiomatic Comprehensions in Examples**: Replaced all `.map(lambda ...)` / `.filter(lambda ...)` calls with list comprehensions across all example apps (basic-full-stack, full-stack-with-auth, all-in-one, early-exit).
- **Automatic Endpoint Caching**: The client runtime now automatically caches responses from reader endpoints (walkers and server functions) and invalidates caches when writer endpoints are called, using compiler-provided `endpoint_effects` metadata. Includes an LRU cache (500 entries, 60s TTL), request deduplication for concurrent identical calls, and automatic cache clearing on auth state changes. No manual `jacInvalidate()` or cache annotations needed.
- **HMR Server-Side Reloading Refactor**: Improved HMR functionality with better handling of `.impl.jac` files and optimized caching to avoid unnecessary recompilations during development
- 3 minor refactor/change.

## jac-client 0.2.19

- **Debug Mode Enabled by Default**: Debug mode is now `true` by default for a better development experience. Raw error output is displayed automatically without needing to configure `debug = true` in `jac.toml`. To disable, set `debug = false` in the `[plugins.client]` section. A warning is shown when running `jac start` in production mode (without `--dev`) with debug enabled, recommending to disable it for production deployments.

- **Update client documetnation and enhance all in one example sith advance routings**
- **Target System Refactoring**: Refactored the client target system for improved scalability and maintainability. Introduced `TargetFactory` singleton with lazy loading for non-web targets (Desktop, PWA), reducing startup overhead when only the default web target is used. Resolved circular import issues by deferring imports to function scope. Extracted magic numbers to named constants (`VITE_DEV_SERVER_PORT`, `DEFAULT_FUNCTION_NAME`) and decomposed `_generate_index_html` into focused helper functions. Added robust process termination with graceful shutdown fallback and safe attribute access chains for module introspection.
- Internal: updated all-in-one jac.toml to enable metrics endpoint

## jac-client 0.2.18

- 2 Minor internal refactors
- **Standardize Jac idioms in examples and runtime**: Replaced JS-style method calls with Jac-idiomatic equivalents across all examples, test fixtures, and the client runtime plugin (`.trim()` → `.strip()`, `.push()` → `.append()`, `.length` → `len()`, `.toUpperCase()/.toLowerCase()` → `.upper()/.lower()`, `console.log()` → `print()`, etc.). These are now translated to the correct JS equivalents at compile time via the primitive emitter infrastructure.

## jac-client 0.2.17

- **Structured Build Error Diagnostics**: Build errors now display formatted diagnostic output with error codes (JAC_CLIENT_XXX), source code snippets pointing to the error location, actionable hints, and quick fix commands. The diagnostic engine maps Vite/npm errors back to original `.jac` files, hiding internal JavaScript paths from developers. Detectors identify common issues: missing npm dependencies (JAC_CLIENT_001), syntax errors (JAC_CLIENT_003), and unresolved imports (JAC_CLIENT_004). Enable `debug = true` under `[plugins.client]` in `jac.toml` or set `JAC_DEBUG=1` to see raw error output alongside formatted diagnostics.

- **Google OAuth Example**: Added a complete `google-auth` example demonstrating Google OAuth authentication with jac-scale's SSO support. Includes authentication provider, protected routes, login/callback pages, and comprehensive README with setup instructions for Google Cloud Console, environment variables, and frontend implementation patterns.
- Various refactors
- **Improved `jac start` Output Ordering**: Fixed misleading output timing where "Server ready" and localhost URLs appeared before compilation completed. The Vite dev server now captures its initial output and waits for the ready signal before displaying status messages, ensuring users see compilation progress first and server URLs only when the server is actually ready to accept connections.
- **PWA Target Support**: Added a new `pwa` target for creating Progressive Web Apps. Run `jac setup pwa` to configure your project with PWA support-this copies default icons to `pwa_icons/` and adds the `[plugins.client.pwa]` config section to `jac.toml`. Then use `jac build --client pwa` to build or `jac start --client pwa` to build and serve. The build generates a web bundle with `manifest.json`, a service worker (`sw.js`) for offline caching, and automatic HTML injection. The service worker implements cache-first for static assets and network-first for API calls (`/api/*`). Configure `theme_color`, `background_color`, `cache_name`, and custom `manifest` overrides in `[plugins.client.pwa]`.
- **Code refactors**: Backtick escape, etc.
- **Environment Variable Support**: Fixed `.env` file loading by configuring Vite's `envDir` to point to the project root instead of the build directory. Variables prefixed with `VITE_` in `.env` files are now properly loaded and available via `import.meta.env` in client code. Added `.env.example` template to the all-in-one example demonstrating standard environment variable patterns.
- **Build-time Constants via jac.toml**: Added support for custom build-time constants through the `[plugins.client.vite.define]` configuration section. Define global variables that are replaced at build time, useful for feature flags, build timestamps, or configuration values. Example: `"globalThis.FEATURE_ENABLED" = true` in `jac.toml` makes `globalThis.FEATURE_ENABLED` available in client code. String values are automatically JSON-escaped to handle special characters safely.
- Updated all-in-one example `jac.toml` to include `[plugins.scale.secrets]` test config.
- **Improved API Error Handling**: Walker and function API calls now check `response.ok` and throw descriptive exceptions on HTTP errors. The `Authorization` header is only sent when a token is present, avoiding empty `Bearer` headers.
- **Better Error Diagnostics**: Silent `except Exception {}` blocks in `jacLogin` and `__jacCallFunction` now log warnings via `console.warn` for easier debugging.

## jac-client 0.2.16

 **Fix: ESM Script Loading**: Added `type="module"` to generated `<script>` tags in the client HTML output. The Vite bundler already produces ES module output, but the script tags were missing the module attribute, causing browsers to reject ESM syntax (e.g., `import`/`export`) from newer npm packages. Affects both the server-rendered page and the `jac build --target web` static output.

- **KWESC_NAME syntax changed from `<>` to backtick**: Updated keyword-escaped names from `<>` prefix to backtick prefix to match the jaclang grammar change.
- **Update syntax for TYPE_OP removal**: Replaced backtick type operator syntax (`` `root ``) with `Root` and filter syntax (`` (`?Type) ``) with `[?:Type]` across all examples, docs, tests, and templates.
- **Support custom Vite Configurations to `dev` mode**: Added support for custom Vite configuration from `jac.toml`.
- **Watchdog auto-install test**: Added test coverage for automatic watchdog installation in dev mode.
- **Updated tests for CLI dependency command redesign**: New `jac add` behavior (errors on missing `jac.toml` instead of silently succeeding). Verify `jac add --npm` works in projects with both pypi and npm dependencies.

## jac-client 0.2.14

## jac-client 0.2.15

## jac-client 0.2.14

- **JsxElement Return Types**: Updated all JSX component return types from `any` to `JsxElement` for compile-time type safety.
- **Updated Fullstack Template**: Modernized the `fullstack` jacpack template to use idiomatic Jac patterns -- `can with entry` lifecycle effects instead of `useEffect`, JSX comprehensions instead of `.map()`, and impl separation (`frontend.impl.jac`) for cleaner code organization. Updated template README with project structure and pattern documentation.
- **E2E Tests**: Now use jacpack workflow for testing.
- **Multi-Profile Config Support**: Added integration test coverage for `--profile` flag to verify profile-specific settings propagate through the client bundling pipeline.
- **File-Based Routing**: Added Next.js-style file-based routing via a `pages/` directory convention. Place `.jac` files under `pages/` and routes are generated automatically -- `pages/index.jac` maps to `/`, `pages/about.jac` to `/about`, `pages/users/[id].jac` to `/users/:id`, and `pages/[...slug].jac` to a catch-all `*` route. Organize routes with parenthesized group directories: `pages/(auth)/` marks enclosed pages as requiring authentication, while `pages/(public)/` keeps them open -- groups control auth without adding URL segments. Add `layout.jac` files at any level for shared layout wrappers rendered via React Router `<Outlet/>`. The compiler detects `pages/`, generates a route manifest (`_routes.js`) with lazy imports, and produces an `_entry.js` that wires up `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, layout nesting, and an `AuthGuard` component that checks `jacIsLoggedIn()` and redirects unauthenticated users (configurable via `auth_redirect` in `jac.toml` routing config). Duplicate route paths and duplicate layouts at the same level raise `ClientBundleError` at compile time. Projects without a `pages/` directory continue to use explicit routing unchanged.

## jac-client 0.2.13

- **Console infrastructure**: Replaced bare `print()` calls with `console` abstraction for consistent output formatting.
- **Desktop App Auto-Start & Port Discovery**: Running `jac start` or `jac dev` for a desktop (Tauri) target now automatically launches the backend API server and connects the app to it -- no manual setup needed. The backend port is dynamically allocated and injected into the webview before any page JavaScript runs, so API calls just work out of the box. Configure a fixed backend URL via `base_url` in `jac.toml` if needed.
- **Bug fixes**: Fixed a sidecar crash caused by writing to a closed stdout pipe, and fixed an environment variable leak during desktop builds.
- **Enhanced Compilation for Hot Module Replacement**: Added initial module compilation for HMR without bundling'.

## jac-client 0.2.12

- **Configurable API Base URL**: Added `[plugins.client.api]` config section with `base_url` option. By default (empty), API calls use same-origin relative URLs. Set `base_url = "http://localhost:8000"` for cross-origin setups.
- **Improved client bundling error handling and reliability:** Captures Vite/Bun output and displays concise, formatted errors after the API endpoint list; fixed the Bun install invocation to improve build reliability.
- **BrowserRouter Migration**: Migrated client-side routing from `HashRouter` to `BrowserRouter`. URLs now use clean paths (`/about`, `/user/123`) instead of hash-based URLs (`#/about`, `#/user/123`). The `navigate()` helper uses `window.history.pushState` with synthetic `PopStateEvent` dispatch instead of setting `window.location.hash`. The Vite dev server config includes `appType: 'spa'` for history API fallback during development. [Breaking Change - See Migration Guide](../breaking-changes.md)
- **Auto-Prompt for Missing Client Dependencies**: When running `jac start` on a project without npm dependencies configured (no `jac.toml` or empty `[dependencies.npm]`), the CLI now detects the missing dependencies and interactively prompts the user to install the default jac-client packages (react, vite, etc.). Accepting writes the defaults to `jac.toml` and proceeds with the build. This follows the same pattern as the existing Bun auto-install prompt and eliminates the cryptic "Cannot find package 'vite'" error that previously occurred. Additionally, stale `node_modules` directories from prior failed installs are now automatically detected and cleaned up before reinstalling.

## jac-client 0.2.11

- **Bun Runtime Migration**: Replaced npm/npx with Bun for package management and JavaScript bundling. Bun provides significantly faster dependency installation and build times. When Bun is not installed, the CLI prompts users to install it automatically via the official installer script.

- **Reactive Effects with `can with entry/exit`**: Similar to how `has` variables automatically generate `useState`, the `can with entry` and `can with exit` syntax now automatically generates React `useEffect` hooks. Use `async can with entry { }` for mount effects (async bodies are automatically wrapped in IIFE), `can with exit { }` for cleanup on unmount, and `can with [dep] entry { }` or `can with (dep1, dep2) entry { }` for effects with dependency arrays. This provides a cleaner, more declarative syntax for React lifecycle management without manual `useEffect` boilerplate.
- **Source Mapping for Vite Errors**: Added source mapping to trace Vite build errors back to original `.jac` files. Compiled JavaScript files now include source file header comments, and a custom `jacSourceMapper` Vite plugin maps error locations to the original Jac source. Source maps are enabled by default for both development and production builds, improving the debugging experience when build errors occur.
- **`@jac/runtime` Canonical Import Path**: Migrated the client runtime import path from `@jac-client/utils` to `@jac/runtime`, aligning with the new `@jac/` scoped package syntax in Jac source code. The jac-client Vite plugin now maps `@jac/runtime` to its own compiled runtime via a resolve alias. Compiled modules include ES module `export` statements so Vite can resolve named imports between modules. All examples, docs, and templates have been updated.
- **Various Refactors**: Including supporting new useEffect primitives, example updates, etc

## jac-client 0.2.10

## jac-client 0.2.9

- **Generic Config File Generation from jac.toml**: Added support for generating JavaScript config files (e.g., `postcss.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`) directly from `jac.toml` configuration. Define configs under `[plugins.client.configs.<name>]` and they are automatically converted to `<name>.config.js` files in `.jac/client/configs/`. This eliminates the need for standalone JavaScript config files in the project root for tools like PostCSS, Tailwind (v3), ESLint, and other npm packages that use the `*.config.js` convention.
- **Error Handling with JacClientErrorBoundary**: Introduced  error boundary handling in Jac Client apps. The new `JacClientErrorBoundary` component allows you to wrap specific parts of your component tree to catch and display errors gracefully, without affecting the entire application.

## jac-client 0.2.8

- **Vite Dev Server Integration for HMR**: Added support for Hot Module Replacement during development. When using `jac start --dev`, the Vite dev server runs alongside the Jac API server with automatic proxy configuration for `/walker`, `/function`, `/user`, and `/introspect` routes. This enables instant frontend updates without full page reloads while maintaining seamless backend communication.

## jac-client 0.2.7

- **Reactive State Variables**: The `jac create --use client` template now uses the new `has` keyword for React state management. Instead of `[count, setCount] = useState(0);`, you can write `has count: int = 0;` and use direct assignment `count = count + 1;`. The compiler automatically generates the `useState` destructuring and transforms assignments to setter calls, providing cleaner and more intuitive state management syntax.
- **Simplified Project Structure**: Reorganized the default project structure created by `jac create --use client`. The entry point is now `main.jac` at the project root instead of `src/app.jac`, and the `components/` directory is now at the project root instead of `src/components/`. This flatter structure reduces nesting and aligns with modern frontend project conventions. Existing projects using the `src/` structure continue to work but new projects use the simplified layout.

- **Configurable Client Route Prefix**: Changed the default URL path for client-side apps from `/page/<app>` to `/cl/<app>`. The route prefix is now configurable via `cl_route_prefix` in the `[serve]` section of `jac.toml`. This allows customizing the URL structure for client apps (e.g., `/pages/MyApp` instead of `/cl/MyApp`). [Documentation](https://docs.jaseci.org/learn/tools/jac_serve/#routing-configuration)

- **Base Route App Configuration**: Added `base_route_app` option in `jac.toml` `[serve]` section to serve a client app directly at the root `/` path. When configured, visiting `/` renders the specified client app instead of the API info page, making it easy to create single-page applications with clean URLs. Projects created with `jac create --use client` now default to `base_route_app = "app"`, so the app is served at `/` out of the box. [Documentation](https://docs.jaseci.org/learn/tools/project_config/#serve-section)

## jac-client 0.2.4

- **`jac-client-node` and `@jac-client/dev-deps` npm packages**: Introduced the new npm libraries  to centralize and abstract default dependencies for Jac client applications. These two package includes React, Vite, Babel, TypeScript, and other essential dependencies.

- **Explicit Export Requirement**: Functions and variables must now be explicitly exported using the `:pub` modifier to be available for import. In previous versions (< 0.2.4), all `def` functions were automatically exported and variables (globals) could not be exported. Starting with 0.2.4, functions and variables are private by default and must be marked with `:pub` to be importable. This provides better control over module APIs and prevents accidental exports. The `app()` function in your entry file must be exported as `def:pub app()`. [Breaking Change - See Migration Guide]

- **Authentication API Update**: Updated authentication functions (`jacLogin` and `jacSignup`) to use `email` instead of `username` for user identification. This change aligns with standard authentication practices and improves security. All authentication examples and documentation have been updated to reflect this change. The `/user/register` and `/user/login` endpoints now accept `email` in the request payload. End-to-end tests have been added to verify authentication endpoint functionality. [Breaking Change - See Migration Guide]

- **Centralized Configuration Management**: Introduced a unified configuration system through `config.json` that serves as the single source of truth for all project settings. The system automatically creates `config.json` when you run `jac create_jac_app`, eliminating the need for manual setup. All build configurations (Vite plugins, build options, server settings) and package dependencies are managed through this centralized file. The system automatically generates `vite.config.js` and `package.json` in `.jac-client.configs/` directory, keeping the project root clean while preserving all essential defaults. [Documentation](https://docs.jaseci.org/jac-client/advance/configuration-overview/)

- **Package Management Through config.json**: Implemented configuration-first package management where all npm dependencies are managed through `config.json` instead of `package.json`. Use `jac add --npm <package>` to add packages and `jac remove --npm <package>` to remove them. Running `jac add --npm` without a package name installs all packages listed in `config.json`. The system automatically regenerates `package.json` from `config.json` and runs npm install, ensuring consistency between configuration and installed packages. Supports both regular and scoped packages with version specification. [Documentation](https://docs.jaseci.org/jac-client/advance/package-management/)

- **CLI Command for Config Generation**: Added `jac generate_client_config` command for legacy projects (pre-0.2.4) to create a default `config.json` file with the proper structure. For new projects, `config.json` is automatically created with `jac create_jac_app`. The command prevents accidental overwrites of existing config files.

- **Centralized Babel Configuration**: Moved Babel configuration from separate `.babelrc` files into `package.json`, centralizing project configuration and reducing file clutter in the project root.

- **TypeScript Support (Enabled by Default)**: TypeScript is now automatically supported in all Jac projects by default. No configuration or prompts needed - TypeScript dependencies are automatically included in `package.json` during build time, and `tsconfig.json` is automatically generated during the first build. TypeScript files (`.ts`, `.tsx`) are automatically processed by Vite bundling, enabling seamless integration of TypeScript/TSX components alongside Jac code. The `components/` directory with a sample `Button.tsx` component is created automatically during project setup. [Documentation](https://docs.jaseci.org/jac-client/working-with-ts/)

## jac-client 0.2.3

- **Nested Folder Structure Preservation**: Implemented folder structure preservation during compilation, similar to TypeScript transpilation. Files in nested directories now maintain their relative paths in the compiled output, enabling proper relative imports across multiple directory levels and preventing file name conflicts. This allows developers to organize code in nested folders just like in modern JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

- **File System Organization Documentation**: Added comprehensive documentation for organizing Jac client projects, including guides for the `app.jac` entry point requirement, backend/frontend code separation patterns, and nested folder import syntax. [Documentation](https://docs.jaseci.org/jac-client/file-system/intro/)

## jac-client 0.2.1

- **CSS File Support**: Added full support for CSS in separate files, enabling cleaner styling structure. Expanded styling options with documented approaches for flexible UI customization. [Documentation](https://docs.jaseci.org/jac-client/styling/intro/)

- **Static Asset Serving**: Introduced static asset serving, allowing images, fonts, and other files to be hosted easily. Updated documentation with step-by-step guides for implementation. [Documentation](https://docs.jaseci.org/jac-client/asset-serving/intro/)

- **Architecture Documentation**: Added comprehensive architecture documentation explaining jac-client's internal design and structure. [View Architecture](https://github.com/jaseci-labs/jaseci/blob/main/jac-client/architecture.md)

- **.cl File Support**: Added support for `.cl` files to separate client code from Jac code. Files with the `.cl.jac` extension can now be used to define client-side logic, improving organization and maintainability of Jac projects.

## jac-client 0.2.0

- **Constructor Calls Supported**: Constructor calls properly supported by automatically generating `new` keyword.

## jac-client 0.1.0

- **Client Bundler Plugin Support**: Extended the existing `pluggy`-based plugin architecture to support custom client bundling implementations. Two static methods were added to `JacMachineInterface` to enable client bundler plugins:
  - `get_client_bundle_builder()`: Returns the client bundle builder instance, allowing plugins to provide custom bundler implementations
  - `build_client_bundle()`: Builds client bundles for modules, can be overridden by plugins to use custom bundling strategies

- **ViteBundlerPlugin (jac-client)**: Official Vite-based bundler plugin providing production-ready JavaScript bundling with HMR, tree shaking, code splitting, TypeScript support, and asset optimization. Implements the `build_client_bundle()` hook to replace default bundling with Vite's optimized build system. Install `jac-client` library from the source and use it for automatic Vite-powered client bundle generation.

- **Import System Fix**: Fixed relative imports in client bundles, added support for third-party npm modules, and implemented validation for pure JavaScript file imports.

- **PYPI Package Release**: First stable release (v0.1.0) now available on PyPI. Install via `pip install jac-client` to get started with Vite-powered client bundling for your Jac projects.
