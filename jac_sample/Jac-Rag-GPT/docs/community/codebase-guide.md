# Codebase Orientation for New Contributors

This repository builds the **Jac programming language** -- a Python-superset with a multi-target compiler (Python bytecode, LLVM native, JavaScript), a graph-native runtime, and an ecosystem of plugins for AI, full-stack web, and cloud deployment. If you're looking to contribute, this guide gives you the mental model and the map you need to navigate the codebase.

## Key Concepts

Before you open any files, these five ideas will save you a lot of confusion:

**Jac is written in Jac.** Most of the compiler and runtime are `.jac` files, not Python. A small bootstrap transpiler (`jac0.py`) is pure Python -- it compiles just enough of the compiler infrastructure (`jac0core/`) so the full compiler can take over and compile itself. Once bootstrapped, the full compiler handles everything else. If you're wondering "how does a Jac compiler compile itself?" -- that's the answer.

**Declaration and implementation are separate.** You'll see pairs like `foo.jac` (declarations/interfaces) and `foo.impl.jac` or `impl/foo.impl.jac` (implementations). This is a first-class Jac language feature, similar to header/source separation. When you're looking for where something is *defined*, check the `.jac` file; for how it *works*, check the `.impl.jac` file.

**The unified AST (`unitree`) is central.** All three compilation targets -- Python, native, and JavaScript -- operate on the same AST. A change to the AST potentially affects all backends, so treat `unitree.jac` edits with care.

**The compiler is a pass pipeline.** Compilation is a sequence of passes, each transforming or annotating the AST. The orchestrator in `compiler.jac` defines which passes run and in what order. Understanding which pass does what is the key to working on the compiler.

**Plugins register via entry points.** You don't need to modify core code to add a plugin -- each plugin declares a `[project.entry-points."jac"]` section in its `pyproject.toml`, and the core runtime discovers and loads it automatically.

If you're new to Jac syntax, skim the [Syntax Cheatsheet](../quick-guide/syntax-cheatsheet.md) or work through [Jac Fundamentals](../tutorials/language/basics.md) before diving into compiler code. Jac reads like Python in most places, but the declaration/implementation split and some other features will look unfamiliar without that primer.

## The Core: `jac/jaclang/`

This is the heart of the project -- the compiler, runtime, CLI, and language server. Everything below is relative to `jac/jaclang/`.

### `jac0core/` -- Compiler Infrastructure

This layer defines the data structures and front-end passes that every compilation target depends on. The compiler orchestrator (`compiler.jac`) lives here and controls which passes run and in what order.

The most important files to know:

- **`unitree.jac`** -- The unified AST that all backends share. If you're adding or changing syntax, you'll touch this.
- **`compiler.jac`** -- The pass pipeline orchestrator. It defines schedules like `get_ir_gen_sched()` and `get_py_code_gen()` that chain passes together. This is the authoritative source for pass ordering.
- **`jir.jac` / `jir_registry.jac`** -- The Jac Intermediate Representation and its node type registry. JIR is the serializable form of compiled modules.
- **`diagnostics.jac`** -- Error and warning reporting infrastructure.
- **`modresolver.jac`** -- Module import and dependency resolution.
- **`passes/`** -- Front-end passes: parsing (via Lark grammar), AST validation, symbol table construction, and declaration-implementation matching.
- **`parser/`** -- The Lark grammar definition and lexer that parse Jac source into the initial AST.

### `compiler/` -- Multi-Target Compilation

Jac compiles to **three targets** from the same unified AST:

```
                            ┌─→ Python bytecode  (passes/main/)
Jac Source → unitree AST  ──┼─→ LLVM IR / native (passes/native/)
                            └─→ JavaScript        (passes/ecmascript/)
```

This means a single language change may need updates in up to three backends. The Python target is the default and most mature; the native and JavaScript targets are actively developed.

The `type_system/` directory houses the type inference engine, type compatibility rules, and type operations shared across targets. The `primitives.jac` file defines core type primitives.

A fourth category -- `passes/tool/` -- contains non-compilation passes for the formatter, linter, doc generator, and grammar extractor.

### Compilation Pass Ordering

The compiler orchestrator in `jac0core/compiler.jac` defines several pass schedules. For the default Python target, the full pipeline runs roughly as follows:

**IR generation** (`get_ir_gen_sched`):

1. `ASTValidationPass` -- Validate AST structure after parsing
2. `SymTabBuildPass` -- Build the symbol table (scopes, bindings)
3. `DeclImplMatchPass` -- Pair declarations with their implementations
4. `SemanticAnalysisPass` -- Resolve names, check imports, validate semantics
5. `SemDefMatchPass` -- Link semantic definitions across modules
6. `CFGBuildPass` -- Build control flow graphs for reachability and flow analysis
7. `MTIRGenPass` -- Generate the mid-tier IR used by downstream passes
8. `UniTreeEnrichPass` -- Annotate the AST with computed semantic information

**Type checking** (`get_type_check_sched`, when enabled):

1. `TypeCheckPass` -- Infer and validate types
2. `StaticAnalysisPass` -- Detect unreachable code, unused variables, etc.
3. `UniTreeEnrichPass` -- Final enrichment with type information

**Code generation** (`get_py_code_gen`):

1. `InteropAnalysisPass` -- Analyze Python interop requirements
2. `EsastGenPass` -- Generate JavaScript AST (for JS target)
3. `NaIRGenPass` -- Generate LLVM IR (for native target)
4. `NativeCompilePass` -- JIT-compile LLVM IR to machine code
5. `PyastGenPass` -- Convert the unitree to a Python AST
6. `PyJacAstLinkPass` -- Link the generated Python AST back to Jac source nodes
7. `PyBytecodeGenPass` -- Compile the Python AST to bytecode

See `jac0core/compiler.jac` for the authoritative ordering -- it uses re-entrancy guards during bootstrap that slightly alter the schedule when the compiler is compiling itself.

### `compiler/passes/native/` -- Native Compilation

The native backend generates LLVM IR via `llvmlite`. The main pass (`na_ir_gen_pass.jac`) delegates to implementation files in `na_ir_gen_pass.impl/`, each handling a different part of the language:

| File | What it covers |
|------|---------------|
| `core.impl.jac` | Module setup, entry points, target triple configuration |
| `stmt.impl.jac` | Statements -- if/else, for/while loops, assignments, returns |
| `expr.impl.jac` | Expressions -- binary/unary ops, comparisons, attribute access |
| `func.impl.jac` | Function definitions, closures, parameter handling |
| `calls.impl.jac` | Function call codegen, argument passing |
| `objects.impl.jac` | Class/struct layout, field access, inheritance chains |
| `types.impl.jac` | Mapping Jac types to LLVM types (i64, double, pointers, etc.) |
| `comprehensions.impl.jac` | List, dict, and set comprehension codegen |
| `builtins.impl.jac` | Builtin function implementations (print, len, range, etc.) |
| `lists.impl.jac`, `dicts.impl.jac`, `sets.impl.jac`, `tuples.impl.jac` | Collection type operations |
| `vtable.impl.jac` | Virtual method dispatch tables for dynamic dispatch |
| `refcount.impl.jac` | Reference counting for memory management |
| `exceptions.impl.jac` | Try/catch/finally, exception propagation |

### `cli/` -- Command-Line Interface

The CLI is organized as a command abstraction in `command.jac` with individual commands (`run`, `start`, `compile`, `format`, `check`, `create`, `plugins`) each in their own directory under `commands/`. The core execution logic -- how `jac run` actually invokes the compiler and runs the result -- lives in `impl/execution.impl.jac`.

### `runtimelib/` -- Runtime Library

This is what Jac programs depend on at execution time. The key modules:

- **`builtin.jac`** -- Builtin functions and types available in every Jac program.
- **`memory.jac`** -- Memory management, including the shelved object store for graph persistence.
- **`server.jac`** -- FastAPI-based HTTP server used by `jac start` to serve walkers as API endpoints.
- **`context.jac`** -- Execution context -- tracks the current graph root, walker state, and runtime configuration.
- **`scheduler.jac`** -- Async task scheduling for concurrent walker execution.
- **`testing.jac`** -- Test runner integration (works with pytest via a custom plugin in `pytest_plugin.py`).
- **`hmr.jac`** -- Hot module reloading -- watches `.jac` files and recompiles on change during development.

### `lsp/` and `langserve/`

These two modules power IDE support. `lsp/` implements the Language Server Protocol (completions, diagnostics, go-to-definition, hover). `langserve/` is the engine underneath -- it manages open modules, coordinates incremental recompilation, and feeds semantic data to the LSP layer. If you're working on IDE features, you'll usually start in `lsp/` for the protocol handling and drop into `langserve/` for the semantic logic.

### `project/`

Handles `jac.toml` configuration parsing, dependency resolution, plugin configuration, and project scaffolding templates.

## Plugin Architecture

Each plugin is a standalone Python package that follows this structure:

```
jac-<name>/
├── <package_name>/
│   ├── plugin.py           # Registers with the Jac runtime
│   ├── plugin_config.py    # Configuration schema
│   └── [implementation]
├── pyproject.toml          # Entry point registration
└── tests/
```

Registration happens in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.entry-points."jac"]
<feature> = "<module>:<Class>"
```

| Plugin | What it adds |
|--------|-------------|
| `jac-byllm` | LLM-powered functions -- annotate a function signature with a docstring and byLLM calls an LLM to implement it at runtime. Depends on `litellm`. |
| `scale` (built into core, `jac/jaclang/scale/`) | Cloud deployment -- wraps `jac start` with FastAPI, adds Kubernetes deployment, Docker builds, MongoDB/Redis storage backends. Ships inside `jaclang`; its optional deps are pulled per-project via `[scale.*]` config + `jac install`. |

(The MCP server -- `jac mcp`, exposing the Jac project to AI coding assistants -- is built into core, not a plugin. See [its source](https://github.com/Jaseci-Labs/jaseci/tree/main/jac/jaclang/cli/mcp) and the [MCP reference](../reference/mcp.md).)

For the full how-to on writing your own plugin -- CLI extension, runtime hook overrides, jac.toml schemas, project templates, and the entry-point setup -- see the [Plugin Authoring Guide](../reference/plugin-authoring.md).

## Tests

Tests are organized in a parallel directory structure under `jac/tests/`, mirroring the source layout:

```
tests/
├── compiler/          # Compiler pass tests
│   └── passes/        # Tests for individual passes
├── language/          # Language feature tests (fixture-based)
├── runtimelib/        # Runtime library tests
├── langserve/         # Language server tests
├── project/           # Project system tests
├── utils/             # Utility tests
└── fixtures_list.jac  # Registry of all test fixtures
```

**Running tests:**

```bash
# All tests (parallel)
pytest jac -n auto

# Specific area
pytest jac/tests/compiler -n auto
pytest jac/tests/language -n auto

# Single test file
pytest jac/tests/compiler/passes/test_type_checker.py -v
```

Many language tests use **fixture files** -- small `.jac` programs in `fixtures/` directories that exercise specific features. The `fixtures_list.jac` file registers them. When you add a new language feature or fix a bug, adding a fixture test is usually the right move.

## Documentation

The docs use [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and live in `docs/`:

```
docs/
├── mkdocs.yml              # Site configuration and navigation
├── docs/
│   ├── quick-guide/        # Getting-started content
│   ├── reference/          # Comprehensive language & API reference
│   ├── tutorials/          # Step-by-step learning content
│   └── community/          # Contributor resources, release notes
└── scripts/                # Doc generation and build scripts
```

There are three documentation tiers with different contributor expectations:

1. **Quick Guide** -- First experience with Jac. Most features don't need to touch this.
2. **Full Reference** -- Must cover everything. **Every feature or change should update the reference docs.**
3. **Tutorials** -- Hands-on learning guides for specific workflows.

**Building docs locally:**

```bash
pip install -e docs
python docs/scripts/mkdocs_serve.py
```
